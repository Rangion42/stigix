# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-12
### Documentation
- **IoT Simulation** 📖 Added complete documentation for `import_prisma_devices.py` in both `IOT_SIMULATION.md` (new Method 3 in device generation section) and `IOT_DEVICE_GENERATOR.md` (full dedicated section with CLI reference, bad behavior logic table, protocol mapping, DHCP fingerprint table, output format, workflow diagram, and updated 3-way comparison table).
- **IoT Simulation** 📸 Added real-world example output (163 devices CSV → 100 by risk → 64 bad-behavior) to illustrate the importer's practical value in customer demo contexts.

## [v1.3.0-patch.59] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Docs** 🖼️ Reduced screenshot sizes in `docs/IOT_SIMULATION.md` for better readability.

## [v1.3.0-patch.58] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Settings** 📐 Traffic Distribution Overview: reverted 2-column grid in favour of **maximised single-column bars** — label column narrowed `w-56` → `w-32` (128px) giving bars ~80% more horizontal room. Bar height raised `h-5` → `h-7`. App label threshold lowered (icon+text visible at >12% instead of >18%, icon-only at >3% instead of >6%) so more apps show their favicon and name directly in the bar.

## [v1.3.0-patch.57] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Settings** 📐 Traffic Distribution Overview: switched from single-column list to **2-column grid** layout. Reduces vertical space by ~50% (from 17 full-width rows to 9 rows × 2 columns). Label column narrowed from `w-56` → `w-40`, bar height `h-6` → `h-5`, row gap tightened.

## [v1.3.0-patch.56] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **IoT** 🏷️ Renamed "Import Prisma CSV" button to **"IoT Security CSV"** — clearer reference to the actual Palo Alto product (Prisma Access → Device Security → IoT Security). Updated button label, modal title, and doc.

## [v1.3.0-patch.55] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **IoT** 🧬 Prisma CSV import — three enrichment improvements to `import_prisma_devices.py`:
  1. **OS-aware DHCP fingerprinting**: added `OS_DHCP_FINGERPRINTS` dict (Windows → `MSFT 5.0`, iOS → `dhcpcd-9.4.1`, Linux/Embedded → `udhcp`, Enea OSE, FortiOS, macOS). OS fingerprint overrides vendor-based default when `os group` or `OS` column is populated.
  2. **Fix protocol column**: switched from `display_apps` (always empty in real exports) to `Applications` → `display_apps` → `display_protos` fallback chain. Devices now get much richer protocol sets.
  3. **Asset Criticality as secondary bad-behavior signal**: when `ml_risk_level` is missing, `Asset Criticality = Critical|High` triggers bad behavior.
  4. **Enriched description**: now includes OS, risk level, criticality, wire/wireless, and VLAN info.
### Changed
- **Docs** 📖 Updated `docs/IOT_SIMULATION.md` Prisma CSV Import section to document OS-aware DHCP, UI import button, enriched description, and correct CLI examples.

## [v1.3.0-patch.54] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🔤 Prisma CSV import: fixed vendor name duplication in generated device names ("HP HP Computer" → "HP Computer", "Atlas Atlas Copco" → "Atlas Copco Torque Controller"). Added `make_name()` helper that checks if the model string already starts with the vendor first-word (case-insensitive, ignoring punctuation like commas) before prepending it.

## [v1.3.0-patch.53] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🐛 Prisma CSV import: script path now uses `PROJECT_ROOT` (same mechanism as other Python scripts) instead of `__dirname`-relative path. Fixes `No such file or directory` error in Docker where `__dirname = /app` and `../iot/` resolved to `/iot/` instead of `/app/iot/`.

## [v1.3.0-patch.52] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **IoT** 📥 New **Import Prisma CSV** button in the IoT Simulation header. Uploads a Prisma Access / IoT Security device export CSV, runs `import_prisma_devices.py` server-side, and imports the resulting devices directly — no manual CLI steps required. Options: max devices (30/50/100/All), IoT-only filter, bad behavior mode (Auto from risk level / All / Percentage / None), and Merge vs Replace. Includes client-side CSV header validation to detect invalid or wrong file format before the backend is called.

## [v1.3.0-patch.51] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Targets** 🐛 Fixed infinite re-appear cycle when deleting a target that was also present in `convergence-endpoints.json` or `voice-config.json`. `deleteTarget()` now removes the host directly from those source files instead of relying on a "promote + disable" workaround that users could break by deleting the disabled entry. The promote+disable path is preserved only for registry (`reg-*`) and env-var-derived targets that cannot be edited locally.

## [v1.3.0-patch.50] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **IoT** 📐 Device cards in the grid view now maintain consistent height whether or not bad behavior badges are shown. The behavior badge container always renders with `min-h-[22px]`, preventing the Start button from shifting down on cards with active attack types.

## [v1.3.0-patch.49] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Registry** 🛡️ Defense-in-depth self-exclusion in `getPeers()` — node now explicitly skips its own `instance_id` from the peer cache, regardless of whether the registry (local or Cloudflare) filtered it out. Prevents inflated `peer_count`, loopback XFR/Voice/Convergence tests, and self-loops in the topology view.

## [v1.3.0-patch.48] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Traffic Control** 🌐 Renamed `Speedtest` button to `Internet Speedtest` and replaced the `Gauge` icon with `Globe` to clearly distinguish it from the XFR/iperf internal bandwidth test.

## [v1.3.0-patch.47] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **Traffic Control** ⚡ Added a `Configure Distribution` shortcut button below the Traffic Generation status line. Clicking it deep-links directly to Settings → Traffic Distribution — same mechanism as the "Manage Probes" button.

## [v1.3.0-patch.46] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Traffic Distribution** 📐 Distribution Overview panel now wrapped in `max-w-7xl mx-auto` to align with the slider blocks below it. Group name column widened from `w-40` (160px) to `w-56` (224px) to prevent truncation of long category names.

## [v1.3.0-patch.45] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **Traffic Distribution** 🗂️ Category groups are now collapsible — click the header to fold/unfold. App count badge visible in header even when collapsed. Chevron rotates on state change.
### Fixed
- **Traffic Distribution** 🔓 Removed the artificial 4-app limit per group. All apps now render with individual sliders regardless of group size.

## [v1.3.0-patch.44] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Build** 🐛 Docker build failure: `Cannot find name 'BarChart3'` — added missing `BarChart3` import from `lucide-react` in `Settings.tsx`.

## [v1.3.0-patch.43] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **Traffic Distribution** 📊 New **Distribution Overview** panel above the sliders — one compact row per category showing a stacked horizontal bar. Each segment is proportional to the app's global traffic weight, displays the app favicon + domain name (adaptive to segment width), and shows a tooltip with exact % on hover.

## [v1.3.0-patch.42] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Navigation UX** 🧭 The "Manage Probes" button in Digital Experience now correctly selects the **Synthetic Probes** sub-menu when navigating to Settings, instead of defaulting to Traffic Distribution.

## [v1.3.0-patch.41] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Security Dashboard** 🏷️ Unified all test verdict labels under a single vocabulary: `Blocked` / `Allowed` / `Inconclusive` — applies to URL Filtering, DNS Security, EICAR, C2 Scenarios, and AI Security tests.
  - `Enforced` (C2/AI) → displayed as **Blocked** (red)
  - `Bypass` (C2/AI) → displayed as **Allowed** (green)
  - `Inconclusive` and `Completed` added as proper states in the unified `getStatusBadge` component
  - Removed `getAIVerdictBadge` / `getC2VerdictBadge` — all test types now use a single `getStatusBadge`
  - Fixed "Bypass" label in EICAR statistics card and Cloud probe summary → now reads "Allowed"
  - Toast notifications for C2/AI results updated accordingly
- **docs/SECURITY_TESTING.md** 📖 Updated all verdict tables and descriptions to reflect the new Blocked/Allowed vocabulary.

## [v1.3.0-patch.40] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **URL Filtering Tests** 🔍 Added `preDnsCheck` pre-resolution step before every curl URL test. A fast `nslookup -timeout=4` now runs first; if the hostname is unresolvable (NXDOMAIN or DNS timeout), the test immediately returns `dns_error` without launching curl. This eliminates the "first test = misleading 10s CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, second test = correct DNS_RESOLUTION_FAILURE" artifact caused by slow first-query DNS proxy resolution in the container.

## [v1.3.0-patch.39] - 2026-05-12
### Added
- **Security Dashboard** 🔗 The "Requires STIGIX_TARGET_MASTER_KEY" warning on the Stigix Cloud EICAR target is now a clickable link. Clicking it navigates directly to Settings → Cloud Target Security and auto-scrolls to the key configuration panel, eliminating the need for manual navigation.

## [v1.3.0-patch.38] - 2026-05-12
### Changed
- **UI Readability** 🎨 Proportional font scale: bumped base `font-size` from `16px` to `17px` so all rem-based Tailwind sizes (text-xs, text-sm, text-base, KPI numbers) scale ~6% together. Added CSS overrides for hardcoded pixel sizes (`text-[9px]` → 10px, `text-[10px]` → 11px, `text-[11px]` → 12px) to preserve visual hierarchy across widget labels.

## [v1.3.0-patch.37] - 2026-05-12
### Changed
- **UI Readability** 🎨 Dark-mode contrast improvements: brightened `--text-muted` CSS token (from `#64748b` to `#7c8fa8`) for improved legibility of secondary labels. Updated font stack to use native system fonts (SF Pro on macOS, Segoe UI on Windows) for sharper text rendering. Navigation tabs bumped from `text-xs` (12px) to `text-sm` (14px). Accent pills and active tab colors updated to `blue-300`/`purple-300` variants for better contrast on dark backgrounds.

## [v1.3.0-patch.36] - 2026-05-12
### Changed
- **Security Dashboard** 🏷️ Renamed test history table headers for better semantic clarity: "Test #" → "Type" (showing URL/DNS/EICAR/C2/AI badge), "Disposition" → "Result" for more intuitive reading of test outcomes.

## [v1.3.0-patch.35] - 2026-05-12
### Fixed
- **Deploy** 🐛 Corrected `COMPOSE_URL` override in `install-latest-beta.sh` to point to the correct beta compose file instead of the production stable one.

## [v1.3.0-patch.34] - 2026-05-12
### Added
- **Deploy** 🧪 New `install-latest-beta.sh` script for testing pre-release deployments. Uses the `latest` Docker image tag and a dedicated beta compose file to allow safe testing of new features before stable promotion.
### Fixed
- **Deploy** 🔑 Applied `JWT_SECRET` auto-generation fix to `install.sh` to prevent fresh installs from using an empty or default secret.

## [v1.3.0-patch.33] - 2026-05-12
### Fixed
- **Security** 🛡️ Resolved a false-positive "offline" status for EICAR targets. Reachability checks now use the UDP convergence port instead of a generic HTTP probe, eliminating incorrect offline classification for EICAR cloud targets.

## [v1.3.0-patch.32] - 2026-05-11
### Documentation
- **Changelog** 📝 Backfilled CHANGELOG with all patches since `patch.16`, bringing the release history up to date.

## [v1.3.0-patch.31] - 2026-05-11
### Changed

### Added
- **Security Dashboard** ⚠️ Added visual warnings and disabled Cloud EICAR targets when the `STIGIX_TARGET_MASTER_KEY` environment variable is missing, preventing silent execution failures.

## [v1.3.0-patch.27] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **System** 🐛 Resolved a critical Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) startup crash on fresh installations caused by uninitialized path references in the `fs.writeFileSync` interceptor.

## [v1.3.0-patch.26] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Dashboard** 🎨 Cleaned up test detail modal typography: consistent `curl` command display formatting and removed excessive uppercase styling from modal content.

## [v1.3.0-patch.25] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Dashboard** 🧹 Removed duplicate "Disposition Reasoning" block that appeared twice in the Security Test Details modal.

## [v1.3.0-patch.24] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Dashboard** 🔡 Removed `text-transform: uppercase` from modal content in Security test details for improved readability of long URLs and hostnames.

## [v1.3.0-patch.23] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Dashboard** 🔧 Enriched URL test diagnostic views with explicit `curl` error classification (connection refused, timeout, SSL error, HTTP code) and consistent curl command string display in the execution log.

## [v1.3.0-patch.22] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **Security Dashboard** 📤 Introduced full Import and Export capabilities for Security Profiles, enabling backup and transfer of custom testing catalogs between Stigix instances.

## [v1.3.0-patch.21] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Framework** 🛡️ Used `EMBEDDED_SECURITY_PROFILE` as fallback in `getSecurityProfile()` when the JSON file is missing or corrupted, preventing a blank security profile on upgrade.

## [v1.3.0-patch.20] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Framework** 🔄 Force-overwrite `security-profile.json` if the file exists but is empty or malformed (e.g. after a failed upgrade), ensuring a valid catalog is always present.

## [v1.3.0-patch.19] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Framework** 🐛 Fixed a `TDZ ReferenceError` (`Cannot access 'X' before initialization`) in `ensureSecurityProfile()` caused by a circular import ordering issue on Node.js startup.

## [v1.3.0-patch.18] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Framework** 🔁 Added automatic `security-profile.json` generation on container upgrade: if the file is absent (first install or upgrade from older version), it is bootstrapped from the embedded catalog without requiring a manual reset.

## [v1.3.0-patch.17] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **Security Framework** ⚙️ Phase 1 — Externalized the previously hardcoded security test catalog into a standalone `security-profile.json` file. Enables per-instance customization of test targets, categories, and expected verdicts without rebuilding the image.
### Documentation
- **Documentation** 📖 Added a comprehensive Azure deployment guide (`AZURE_INSTALL.md`) covering VM sizing, NSG rules, Docker setup, and one-liner install.

## [v1.3.0-patch.16] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **Documentation Overhaul** 📖 Massive visual update across all core modules:
    - **Convergence Lab**: Added 5 high-fidelity screenshots documenting live failover monitoring and historical timeline deep-dives.
    - **IoT Simulation**: Added 4 screenshots covering the new device gallery, bad behavior configuration, and real-time Scapy logs.
    - **VoIP Simulation**: Added 4 screenshots illustrating the deterministic source port mapping (31000+) and per-target QoS statistics.
    - **VyOS Control**: Added 6 screenshots showcasing automated impairment missions, sequence editing, and live mission timelines.
- **Documentation Style** 🎨 Harmonized all visual assets with descriptive, premium-style captions for improved technical clarity.
- **README** 📊 Updated Statistics and VoIP counts in the main project gallery to reflect the new documentation depth.

## [v1.3.0-patch.15] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **Network Status** 🌍 Added a country flag emoji next to the Public IP address in the Network Status widget, derived from a geo-IP lookup, for instant visual identification of the egress region.

## [v1.3.0-patch.14] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 🎨 Fixed vertical alignment of `TYPE` and `STATUS` badge elements in the Connectivity probes table so they align consistently across all row heights.

## [v1.3.0-patch.13] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 📐 Fixed text alignment of metrics values (Avg/Min/Max scores) displayed in the Last Score column to ensure consistent right-alignment and prevent visual misalignment on varying screen widths.

## [v1.3.0-patch.12] - 2026-05-10
### Changed
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 📈 Displayed the `Avg`, `Min`, and `Max` scores directly under the `Last Score` column in the main probes table for immediate visibility.


## [v1.3.0-patch.11] - 2026-05-10
### Changed
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 🎨 Improved the Probe detail modal:
  - Hidden HTTP-specific timing columns (DNS, TCP, TLS, TTFB, HTTP Code) for non-HTTP/CLOUD probes (e.g., PING, UDP) for a cleaner UI.
  - Added a distinct probe type badge directly in the modal title.
  - The entire row in the main dashboard table is now clickable to open probe details.
  - Renamed "Manage Endpoints" button to "Manage Probes".
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 📊 Added underlying data model tracking for minimum and maximum probe scores to support future notification triggers.

## [v1.3.0-patch.10] - 2026-05-09
### Fixed
- **VyOS Engine** 🛡️ Added a fallback mechanism for `deny-traffic` (simple-block) to automatically support mixed fleets of VyOS devices. If a router rejects the modern VyOS 1.4/1.5 syntax (tag as a child of blackhole), the engine will seamlessly catch the 400 error and retry with the legacy syntax (tag as a sibling of blackhole).

## [v1.3.0-patch.9] - 2026-05-09
### Fixed
- **VyOS Engine** 🐛 Fixed an issue where `deny-traffic` (simple-block) failed on newer VyOS versions (1.4/1.5) with a `400 Bad Request`. The API payload now correctly places the `tag` node as a child of the `blackhole` node instead of a sibling, aligning with the updated VyOS CLI syntax.

## [v1.3.0-patch.8] - 2026-05-09
### Changed
- **Security Dashboard** 🎨 Added a "BETA" badge to the **C2 Attack Scenarios** and **AI Security Tests** panels to indicate their new status.
- **Security Dashboard** 📏 Fixed header alignment in the AI Security Tests and C2 Attack Scenarios panels for better visual consistency.

## [v1.3.0-patch.7] - 2026-05-09
### Changed
- **Security Dashboard** 🎨 Refined the detailed test result modal:
    - Renamed **Telemetry Diagnostic** to **Security Test Details** for better clarity.
    - Renamed **Detailed Observation Log** to **Detailed Execution Log**.
    - Renamed **Diagnostic Error Signature** to **Test Error Signature**.
    - Renamed **Cloud Diagnostic** to **Cloud Execution Context**.
    - Renamed the footer button to **Close Details**.
- **Security Dashboard** 🧹 Cleaned up typography and spacing in the detail modal headers.

## [v1.3.0-patch.6] - 2026-05-08
### Added
- **AI Security Tests** 🤖 New dedicated **AI Security** panel in the Security dashboard mirroring the Palo Alto AISA PowerShell simulation script. Includes 5 scenarios: DLP Credit Card extraction, Prompt Injection/Jailbreak, Misfortune Cookie (CVE-2014-9222), EICAR Malware Upload to AI apps, and Volume Traffic Generator (24 AI apps across 6 categories). 🚀
- **AI Security Backend** `POST /api/security/ai-test` and `POST /api/security/ai-test-batch` routes — each scenario runs `curl` against live AI app endpoints (ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, Perplexity) and aggregates verdicts across all targets.
- **AI Security Scheduler** ⏰ Configurable periodic scheduler for AI Security scenarios — identical to DNS/URL/C2 scheduler controls. Config key: `scheduled_execution.ai`.
- **Verdict System** `Enforced` (green) / `Bypass` (red) / `Completed` (cyan, volume test only) / `Inconclusive` (orange) — inverted logic consistent with C2 module.
- **Security Log** 🏷️ `AIS` badge type (cyan) in the Security Test Log; `AI Security` filter option in the history dropdown.
- **shared/security-categories.ts** `AI_SECURITY_SCENARIOS`, `AI_PRIORITY_APPS`, `AI_VOLUME_APPS` exports with `AISecurityScenario` interface.
- **test-logger.ts** Extended `TestResult` to support `type:'ai'` and status `'completed'`; updated `LogStats` stats counters.
### Documentation
- **docs/SECURITY_TESTING.md** (v3.1) Comprehensive **AI Security Tests** section documenting all 5 scenarios with exact execution sequences, PowerShell script equivalents, verdict rules, troubleshooting guides, and SSL Inspection requirements. 📖

## [v1.3.0-patch.5] - 2026-05-08
### Fixed
- **Build** 🐛 Docker build failed with `TS2304: Cannot find name 'SchedulerControl'` — renamed to the correct `SchedulerSettings` component and widened its `type` prop union to include `'c2'`. Previously the C2 scheduler panel referenced a non-existent component name.
- **Security.tsx** Widened `updateSchedule` function type from `'url' | 'dns' | 'threat'` to `'url' | 'dns' | 'threat' | 'c2'` to resolve implicit `any` TypeScript errors on C2 scheduler callbacks.

## [v1.3.0-patch.4] - 2026-05-08
### Fixed
- **Security Log** 🐛 C2 entries now show badge `C2S` (was incorrectly showing `THREAT`) — root cause: `TestLogger` was receiving `type:'threat'` instead of `type:'c2'` for all c2_scenario entries
- **Security Log** 🐛 C2 disposition now shows `Enforced` / `Bypass` / `Inconclusive` (was showing `Unknown`) — root cause: `TestResult.status` type union didn't include C2 verdict values, and `result` object wasn't reconstructed with full details from logger
- **Test Logger** Extended `TestResult` interface to support `type:'c2'` and status values `'enforced' | 'bypass' | 'inconclusive'`; updated `LogStats` accordingly

### Added
- **C2 Panel** ⏰ C2 Scheduler — configurable interval (5/10/15/30/45/60m) + enable toggle + next run time display, identical to DNS and URL scheduler controls
- **Backend** Scheduled C2 runner (`runScheduledC2Tests`) fires all 7 scenarios sequentially on the configured interval; integrated into `startSchedulers()` with 800ms inter-test delay
- **Backend** `scheduled_execution.c2` added to `DEFAULT_SECURITY_CONFIG` and auto-migration guard for existing configs

## [v1.3.0-patch.3] - 2026-05-08
### Added
- **Security Dashboard** 📋 C2 scenario cards now show the last verdict badge inline (Enforced/Bypass/Inconclusive) — same behavior as DNS and URL cards in the screenshot.
- **Backend** 🔍 Each C2 scenario now produces a detailed step-by-step sequence log in `details.output`, visible in the Telemetry Diagnostic modal. Includes exact command, intent, engine, raw output, and verdict decision per step.
- **Documentation** 📖 New comprehensive `C2 Attack Scenarios` section in `docs/SECURITY_TESTING.md` (v3.0): exact test sequence, PowerShell equivalents, verdict rules tables, per-scenario firewall engine requirements, and full troubleshooting guide for each of the 7 scenarios.

## [v1.3.0-patch.2] - 2026-05-08
### Added
- **Security Dashboard** 🎯 New **C2 Attack Scenarios** panel in the Security page, reproducing the exact 7-step Prisma Access security simulation script (SQL Injection, DNS C2 Infiltration, Greyware DNS, Compromised DNS, Sliver C2 Emulation, EICAR over HTTPS, DNS Tunneling Burst).
- **Backend** 🔌 Two new API routes: `POST /api/security/c2-test` (individual scenario) and `POST /api/security/c2-test-batch` (batch). Each scenario mirrors the PowerShell reference script: `nslookup ... 8.8.8.8` for DNS scenarios, `curl` for HTTP/HTTPS ones.
- **Verdict System** 🚦 Inverted verdict logic for C2 tests: `Enforced` (green) = threat was blocked/sinkholed, `Bypass` (red) = policy gap detected, `Inconclusive` = timeout/error.
- **Security Test Log** 📋 New `C2S` badge type in the log table, dedicated filter option "C2 Scenarios" in the dropdown, and correct "C2 Simulation" label in the Telemetry Diagnostic modal.
- **shared/security-categories.ts** 📦 New `C2_SCENARIOS` export with `C2Scenario` interface including CLI hint commands for each scenario.

## [v1.3.0-patch.1] - 2026-05-05
### Fixed
- **Web Dashboard**: 🐛 Fixed an issue where the `PORT` environment variable specified in `docker-compose.yml` was ignored. The dashboard port is no longer hardcoded to `8080` in `supervisord.conf`, allowing custom port bindings like `- PORT=8085` to work correctly.


## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-04
### Changed
- **Version Bump**: 🚀 Milestone release bumping the version to 1.3.0. This release consolidates all recent feature additions, VyOS orchestration integrations, and UI enhancements into a stable minor version.

## [v1.2.2-patch.172] - 2026-05-04
### Fixed
- **Web Dashboard**: 🐛 Fixed an issue in the Failover Monitoring (Convergence Lab) view where the stop button for an individual target in the "Stigix Targets" list remained greyed out and unclickable while a test was actively running.

## [v1.2.2-patch.171] - 2026-05-04
### Fixed
- **VyOS Engine**: 🐛 Fixed a bug where `allow-traffic` (simple-unblock) failed with "not blocked (tag 999 not found)" because the REST API parser was incorrectly looking for the `tag` attribute nested inside the `blackhole` presence node instead of as a sibling route attribute.
- **Web Dashboard**: 🧹 Fixed visual clutter in the Sequence Timeline where impairment parameters (latency, loss, rate) were incorrectly rendered for non-QoS actions like `deny-traffic`.
- **Web Dashboard**: 🧹 Fixed the Sequence Editor so that switching an action command (e.g. from `set-qos` to `deny-traffic`) automatically scrubs incompatible parameters from the configuration payload.

## [v1.2.2-patch.170] - 2026-04-30
### Changed
- **Web Dashboard**: 🔎 Enhanced history search. The sequence history search bar now comprehensively filters through human-readable router names, executed commands, target interfaces, parameters, and execution results (errors & status) simultaneously.

## [v1.2.2-patch.169] - 2026-04-30
### Added
- **Web Dashboard**: 🔍 Introduced a dynamic search bar in the VyOS sequence manager to instantly filter sequences by name, router focus, or underlying actions.
- **Web Dashboard**: 🔀 Added intelligent sorting to group sequences by target router, action command type, alphabetical name, or most recently executed.
- **Web Dashboard**: 🔄 Implemented "Clone to Reverse" functionality to automatically generate inverse automation sequences (e.g., swapping `interface-down` for `interface-up`, `set-qos` for `clear-qos`) with a single click.

## [v1.2.2-patch.168] - 2026-04-28
### Added
- **IoT DHCP**: In-kernel **BPF filter** (`udp src port 67 dst port 68`) replaces slow Python `lfilter` for DHCP packet capture — runs in the kernel before Python, no more missed ACKs under load. `stop_filter` terminates sniff immediately on XID match. ⚡
- **IoT DHCP**: **OFFER-without-ACK fallback** — 3-level hierarchy:
  1. ✅ Full ACK received → IP confirmed from DHCP server (best)
  2. 🟡 OFFER received but ACK timed out (unicast ACK dropped by kernel, DHCP snooping, etc.) → uses offered IP + detects host gateway from `ip route show default` → sends gratuitous ARP
  3. ❌ No OFFER at all → device stays silent until renewal loop retries
- **IoT DHCP**: `_get_host_gateway()` helper reads the host routing table as gateway fallback when no DHCP ACK is available. 🌐
- **IoT DHCP**: `_sniff_dhcp()` reusable helper shared by OFFER and ACK capture steps.
- **IoT DHCP**: `_dhcp_attempt()` now returns `'ack_ok' | 'offer_no_ack' | 'no_offer' | 'error'` instead of `bool` for full fallback context. 🔄

## [v1.2.2-patch.167] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT DHCP**: `self.ip` was assigned at REQUEST time (from the OFFER) before ACK confirmation. If ACK timed out, the stale offered IP leaked into `self.ip` — `_boot_sequence()` saw a non-null IP and started protocol threads with a ghost IP and no gateway (`HTTP SYN to None:80`). 🐛
  - Fix: removed premature `self.ip = dhcp_offered_ip` from REQUEST block.
  - `self.ip` is now exclusively set at line `msg_type == 5` (ACK confirmed).
  - `do_dhcp_sequence()` explicitly resets `self.ip = None` and `self.gateway = None` after all retries exhaust without success.

## [v1.2.2-patch.166] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT Daemon**: `SyntaxError: name 'ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR' is assigned to before global declaration` crashing the daemon on Python 3.12. 🔥
  - Root cause: two `global ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR` declarations in different `elif` branches of the same `daemon_loop()` function.
  - Fix: moved the single `global ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR` declaration to the very top of `daemon_loop()`, removing the per-branch declarations.

## [v1.2.2-patch.165] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT Bad Behavior**: Added early exit guard inside inner loops for all remaining behavior types — Clean Mode now stops ALL attack traffic within < 0.5s of clicking the button. 🛑
  - **C2 Beacon**: between DNS send and HTTP send (was waiting 1s)
  - **Data Exfil**: inside the 5-packet upload burst (was waiting 0.5s per packet)
  - **PAN Test DNS**: inside the 5-query burst (was waiting 1s per query)
  - **PAN Test URL**: inside the 3-URL burst (was waiting 2s per URL)

## [v1.2.2-patch.164] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT Bad Behavior**: `disable_bad_behavior` daemon command was missing `global ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR` declaration → Python created a local variable that disappeared immediately, leaving the global flag `True`. Clean Mode appeared to activate in the UI but had zero effect — devices stopped then restarted would still launch attacks. 🐛
- **IoT DNS Flood**: Added early exit inside the 10-query burst loop — thread stops within 0.5s of clean mode toggle instead of finishing the full burst. ⚡
- **IoT Port Scan**: Same early exit inside the 10-port scan loop — stops within 0.1s. ⚡

## [v1.2.2-patch.163] - 2026-04-28
### Performance
- **IoT Daemon**: Staggered device boot — each new device waits `(index × 2s + 0–1s jitter)` before calling `start()`. 30 devices spread over ~62 seconds instead of simultaneously → eliminates DHCP Discover storm on the router. ⏳
### Fixed
- **IoT Boot Sequence**: Refactored `start()` into a `_boot_sequence()` inner function:
  1. DHCP runs **blocking** (no more `time.sleep(2)` hack)
  2. If no IP after DHCP → abort silently, protocol threads and bad behavior **do NOT start**
  3. Protocol threads start only after IP is confirmed
  4. Bad behavior starts only after IP is confirmed — eliminates `💀 RANDOM MIX started` with no IP or gateway

## [v1.2.2-patch.162] - 2026-04-28
### Added
- **IoT**: Global **Bad Behavior toggle** button (`🗡️ Clean Mode` / `💀 Attack ON`) in the IoT filter bar — enables or disables attack mode across all configured devices in one click without restarting. 🔴
- **IoT Filter**: Search field now matches **MAC addresses** — type any OUI prefix or full MAC to filter devices. 🔍
### Fixed
- **DHCP**: Retry logic upgraded to **3 full attempts** with exponential backoff (2s, 4s between retries). Each attempt re-runs the full Discover→Offer→Request→ACK cycle. Timeout per phase raised to 4s. Eliminates fallback to hardcoded `192.168.207.x`. 🔄
- **DHCP**: Bad behavior threads now respect the global `ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR` flag — toggling clean mode stops attack traffic on the next loop iteration without device restart. ✅

## [v1.2.2-patch.161] - 2026-04-28
### Performance
- **IoT Architecture**: Migrated from **N processes (1 per device)** to a single persistent Python daemon managing all devices as internal threads. 🚀
  - RAM: ~600MB (30 devices) → ~50MB. CPU overhead dramatically reduced.
  - Practical device limit: ~15–20 → **100+ devices** on the same container.
  - Single process reads JSON commands from stdin: `start`, `stop`, `stop_all`, `status`, `enable_bad_behavior`, `disable_bad_behavior`.
  - All UI events (`device:log`, `device:stats`, `device:started`, `device:stopped`) unchanged — fully transparent to the frontend.
- **IoT Daemon**: Exponential backoff restart strategy in `iot-manager.ts` — 5 max retries (2s→4s→8s→16s→30s), re-sends start commands for all tracked devices on recovery. 🔁
- **IoT UI**: Persistent red banner displayed when daemon gives up after 5 crash-restart cycles. 🔴

## [v1.2.2-patch.160] - 2026-04-28
### Added
- **IoT DHCP**: `BOOTP` broadcast flag (`0x8000`), explicit `htype=1` / `hlen=6`, DHCP Option 57 (`max_dhcp_size=1500`) for realistic network stack fingerprinting. 📡
- **IoT ARP**: Gratuitous ARP (`is-at`) sent immediately after DHCP ACK — critical MAC↔IP binding signal for Prisma IoT Security classification. 📣
- **IoT DHCP**: ARP thread now waits for valid IP+gateway from DHCP before initiating requests. ⏳
### Fixed
- **IoT Bad Behavior**: Bad behavior threads skip gateway-targeted actions when gateway has not been learned yet (no more spurious traffic to unrelated IPs). 🛡️

## [v1.2.2-patch.159] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT UI**: Replaced vendor `<select>` dropdown with a free-text `<input>` field — vendor names from imported JSON (e.g., "Apple Inc.", "VMware, Inc.") are now preserved instead of defaulting to "Generic". ✅
- **IoT Emulator**: Default gateway changed from hardcoded `192.168.207.1` to `None` — emulator now waits for the gateway address from the DHCP ACK dynamically. 🌐

## [v1.2.2-patch.158] - 2026-04-28
### Changed
- **IoT Import**: Removed `ip_start` field from `import_prisma_devices.py` JSON export — devices now use the site DHCP server exclusively, no subnet assignment. 🔄

## [v1.2.2-patch.157] - 2026-04-28
### Added
- **IoT Import**: `--max-devices N` option on `import_prisma_devices.py` — limits generated output to the top N highest-risk devices (default 30, sorted by risk score descending). 📋
### Documentation
- Updated `generate_iot_devices.md` with `--max-devices` option reference. 📚

## [v1.2.2-patch.156] - 2026-04-28

## [v1.2.2-patch.154] - 2026-04-27
### Added
- **Voice/RTP**: Full legacy behavior emulation in RTP debug mode — `tos=0`, randomized source port for DPI bypass during media classification testing. 🎙️

## [v1.2.2-patch.153] - 2026-04-27
### Fixed
- **Voice/RTP**: Debug logs from `rtp.py` forwarded to `stderr` to prevent orchestrator `stdout` capture from mixing log and data streams. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.152] - 2026-04-27
### Added
- **Voice/RTP**: DEBUG mode in `rtp.py` — strips CID prefix from RTP payload to support DPI media classification by Prisma Access. 🔬

## [v1.2.2-patch.151] - 2026-04-27
### Fixed
- **VyOS Control**: Improved unblock error handling when IP is part of a larger subnet — displays actionable error message instead of silent failure. 🛡️

## [v1.2.2-patch.150] - 2026-04-27
### Added
- **VyOS Control**: Detailed error messages from the VyOS API are now surfaced directly in the history view for faster troubleshooting. 📋

### Fixed
- **System**: Corrupted counter parsing in log rotation logic. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.136] - 2026-04-26
### Fixed
- **Cloud Probes**: Validation now blocks saving Cloud Probe configuration if Master Key or TSG ID is missing — prevents silent misconfiguration. 🔐

## [v1.2.2-patch.135] - 2026-04-26
### Added
- **Connectivity UI**: Timing Analysis area chart now available for **CLOUD probes** (DNS, TCP, TLS, TTFB breakdown). 📊

## [v1.2.2-patch.134] - 2026-04-26
### Added
- **Connectivity UI**: DNS, TCP, TLS, and TTFB columns added to the **Recent Captures** table for detailed timing visibility. 📋

### Fixed
- **Connectivity UI**: IP Address and HTTP status code now correctly mapped and displayed for CLOUD probes in the Recent Captures table. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.132] - 2026-04-26
### Changed
- **Cloud Probes**: Replaced `fetch()` with `curl` for CLOUD probe execution — exposes granular DNS/TCP/TLS/TTFB timing metrics unavailable via the Fetch API. ⚡

## [v1.2.2-patch.131] - 2026-04-26
### Added
- **Probe Configuration**: TCP/UDP placeholder text and helper hints added to the Probe Configuration modal for better user guidance. ℹ️

## [v1.2.2-patch.121] - 2026-04-25
### Added
- **Security Score**: **Threat Prevention Score** widget — tracks EICAR test outcomes alongside URL and DNS scores in the Score Dashboard. 🛡️

## [v1.2.2-patch.120] - 2026-04-25
### Added
- **Security Score**: **Latest Changes** timestamps now include full date context for cross-day comparisons. 📅

## [v1.2.2-patch.119] - 2026-04-25
### Added

## [v1.2.2-patch.111] - 2026-04-25
### Added
- **Targets**: Global **target reachability monitoring** — all targets are continuously pinged and status is displayed in real-time across all modules. 📡

## [v1.2.2-patch.110] - 2026-04-25
### Fixed
- **CI/CD**: Retried build after GitHub transient 502 error. 🔄

## [v1.2.2-patch.109] - 2026-04-25

## [v1.2.2-patch.101] - 2026-04-24
### Added
- **Security Score**: Score Trend chart with configurable time range and improved dot rendering for dense data sets. 📊

## [v1.2.2-patch.100] - 2026-04-22
### Refactored
- **Target Worker Auth**: Removed `SHARED_KEY` / `STIGIX_TARGET_SHARED_KEY` — `MASTER_SIGNATURE_KEY` is now the only supported authentication method. Derived key per request: `SHA256(TSGID:MASTER_KEY)`. Worker falls through to open-access if no master key is configured. 🔐
- **target-manager.ts**: Removed `STIGIX_TARGET_SHARED_KEY` env fallback and the PoC derived key (`SHA256(tsg:clientId:stigix-v1)`). Clear warnings logged when key is missing. 🧹
### Changed
- **docker-compose.yml**: Removed `STIGIX_TARGET_SHARED_KEY` env variable. 🐳
- **install.sh**: Removed `STIGIX_TARGET_SHARED_KEY` from generated `.env` template.
- **docs**: Updated `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` and `.env.example` to reflect single-key auth model. 📚

## [v1.2.2-patch.99] - 2026-04-22
### Performance
- **Traffic Generator**: Added `--ipv4` flag to all `curl` calls. Host has no IPv6 route — without this, curl tried all AAAA addresses first (each failing with "Network is unreachable") before falling back to A records, wasting 1–2s per request on dual-stack destinations. ⚡

## [v1.2.2-patch.98] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Rate Card**: `currentRpm` was never persisted — Traffic Rate always showed `0` on browser refresh. Now seeded from the last history entry on init and written to `localStorage` as `stigix_rpm_cache` on every update. 📊
- **History Writer**: The 60s snapshot collector (`traffic-history.jsonl`) was reading `stats.json` directly (the old single-client file) instead of calling `aggregateStats()`. With multi-client traffic, this recorded ~1/N of actual traffic, causing chart totals to diverge from stat cards and seeding wrong RPM on refresh. Fixed to use `aggregateStats()` consistently. 🛠️
- **Rotation**: Replaced `exec(wc -l / tail)` in history rotation with pure `fs` to avoid exec buffer limit issues.

## [v1.2.2-patch.97] - 2026-04-22
### Added
- **Dashboard Persistence**: Stats and chart history now survive browser refresh via `localStorage` caching. 💾
  - `stats` initialized from `stigix_stats_cache` on load — no flash to zero on refresh.
  - History cached per time-range key (`stigix_history_1h/6h/24h`, last 300 points).
  - `fetchHistory()` and live `processStats()` both write to localStorage on every update.
  - Switching time ranges immediately shows the cached history while the API loads.

## [v1.2.2-patch.96] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Control Dashboard**: Switching to another tab caused the entire Traffic Control view (including `LineChart`) to unmount. On return, recharts re-animated the line from zero. Fixed by keeping the dashboard always mounted in the DOM with CSS `hidden` class — component never unmounts. 🔒
- **Chart**: Added `isAnimationActive={false}` on the `Line` component as a safety net against edge-case remounts.

## [v1.2.2-patch.95] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Polling Intervals**: Tab switching triggered a full teardown and restart of all polling intervals because `view` was in the main `useEffect` dependency array. Split into two separate effects — initialization (runs once on login) and view-specific polling — preventing interval churn on navigation. ⏱️

## [v1.2.2-patch.94] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Chart Axes**: Y/X axis labels were invisible in light mode. SVG elements inside recharts cannot inherit CSS custom properties. Replaced dynamic `var(--color-text-muted)` with concrete `#64748b` (neutral slate). 🎨
- **Stats Aggregation**: Implemented 3-minute recency filter in `aggregateStats()` — only stats files modified within the last 3 minutes are included, preventing stale files from previous container runs or crashed workers from polluting totals. 🧹
- **Density Default**: Stop API endpoint now explicitly resets `client_count` to `1` on disk, ensuring the UI slider correctly reflects the state on fresh startups. 🎛️

## [v1.2.2-patch.93] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Dashboard API**: `/api/admin/system/dashboard-data` was reading `stats.json` (legacy single-client file) directly instead of calling `aggregateStats()`. Multi-client stats were never reflected in the stat cards. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.92] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Generator**: `STATS_FILE` variable was assigned before `CLIENTID` was set — all workers wrote to `stats-.json` (empty suffix) instead of their own `stats-client-XX-YYY.json` file. Fixed initialization order. 🐛

## [v1.2.2-patch.91] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Generator**: `getWeightedApp()` was called inside a `$(...)` subshell for process detection — the app cache array built inside never persisted to the parent shell, so `jq` ran on every single request. Refactored to use an internal PID registry and moved cache initialization to the parent scope. ⚡
- **Backend**: Fixed `maxBuffer` crash in `exec()` calls when log output exceeded the Node.js default buffer limit. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.90] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Generator**: Replaced `pgrep` (unreliable for detecting worker processes by name) with an internal PID registry array in the master loop, ensuring accurate worker count tracking and scale-up/scale-down decisions. 🔄

## [v1.2.2-patch.89] - 2026-04-22
### Performance
- **Traffic Generator**: Three targeted optimizations for density scaling: pre-cached application list, reduced sleep granularity for faster ramp-up, and improved worker lifecycle management. ⚡

## [v1.2.2-patch.88] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Generator**: Stabilized multi-client scaling logic and fixed stats aggregation across parallel worker processes. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.87] - 2026-04-22
### Added
- **Traffic Generator**: Multi-client scaling — the master process dynamically spawns/terminates worker instances based on the configured `client_count` density slider. Each worker writes its own `stats-client-XX-YYY.json` file. Workers are identified by a shared session suffix. 📈
- **Dashboard**: Traffic Density slider (1–10 parallel clients) and Traffic Speed slider exposed in the Traffic Control panel. 🎛️

## [v1.2.2-patch.82] - 2026-04-22
### Added
- **Security Score**: Min/max score display on gauge cards. 📊
- **Security Score**: "Change" column in test result tables showing delta vs. previous run.
- **Security Score**: "Changes Only" filter to focus the result list on categories that shifted status.
- **Security Score**: 24h score trend visualization. 📈

## [v1.2.2-patch.75] - 2026-04-21
### Changed
- **Security Score**: Added score description subtitles on each gauge card — URL Score explains "Weighted % of malicious URL categories correctly blocked by firewall", DNS Score explains "Weighted % of malicious DNS domains correctly blocked or sinkholed". 📝
- **Security Score**: Added `ⓘ` tooltip on the BASELINE label explaining the purpose of pinning a reference run and how gap alerting works. 💡

## [v1.2.2-patch.74] - 2026-04-21
### Added
- **Security Score**: Added **Latest Changes** panel — client-side diff between the two most recent consecutive runs per type (URL/DNS). Shows exactly which categories changed status with `↓ GAP` / `↑ FIXED` / `CHG` badges and a time range. No baseline required. 🔍
- **Security Score**: Chart dot decimation — dots now only appear every 5-minute window to prevent clutter when tests run every minute. The score line itself still renders all data points. ⚡

## [v1.2.2-patch.73] - 2026-04-21
### Added
- **Security Score**: Run markers on the Score Trend chart — colored dots (🟣 URL, 🔵 DNS) appear at each actual test execution. Scheduled runs display an additional outer ring to distinguish them from manual runs. 📍
- **Security Score**: Rich custom chart tooltip showing exact date/time, trigger type (▶ Manual / 🕐 Scheduled), and both URL+DNS scores on hover. 🎯
- **Security Score**: Legend in chart header: `● URL  ● DNS  ○ Scheduled`. 📊

## [v1.2.2-patch.72] - 2026-04-21
### Fixed
- **Security Score**: Fixed `ScoreDashboard` not showing any data — all 5 `fetch()` calls were missing `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers, causing silent 401 responses. Added `token` prop to `ScoreDashboard`, passed from `Security.tsx` parent. 🔐

## [v1.2.2-patch.71] - 2026-04-21
### Fixed
- **Security Score**: Fixed `runId` missing from `TestResult` interface in `test-logger.ts`. TypeScript was silently dropping the `runId` field on every logged entry, making score grouping impossible — `generateRunScore()` always found 0 results and returned early. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.42] - 2026-04-17
### Changed
- **Settings UI**: Restructured the Custom Probe Configuration form layout. Upgraded from a cramped 4-column layout into a spacious 2-column grid layout spanning two rows to completely eliminate tight text wrapping. 📐

## [v1.2.2-patch.41] - 2026-04-17
### Added
- **Probes**: Implemented dynamically configurable probe frequencies natively within the Settings UI (tunable from `30s` to `3600s`). ⏱️
- **Backend Engine**: Demolished the legacy 60-second blocking scheduler and deployed a non-blocking asynchronous multiplexer. Probes now execute simultaneously relying on their precise individual intervals without overlapping or blocking! 🚀

## [v1.2.2-patch.40] - 2026-04-17
### Added
- **Speedtest**: Enforced a dynamic 10s minimum and 300s maximum duration constraint on the UI, coupled with clear visual indicator text `MIN 10 — MAX 300` right above the input field to perfectly align user expectations. ⏱️

## [v1.2.2-patch.39] - 2026-04-17
### Added
- **Settings UI**: Re-styled the Probe form, injecting an explicit `MIN 1000 — MAX 60000` helper text directly opposite the Timeout label for superior transparency. ✨

## [v1.2.2-patch.38] - 2026-04-17
### Added
- **Probes**: Introduced an editable `Timeout (ms)` property natively into the Synthetic Probes UI builder, giving users maximum tuning control over execution limits. ⚙️
- **Probes**: Injected a bulletproof `1000ms` safe-minimum limit to protect the backend bash-level tools from zero-timeout infinite execution traps. 🛡️

## [v1.2.2-patch.37] - 2026-04-17
### Added
- **Convergence Dashboard**: Added Live Packet Loss tracking chart to the convergence timeline display. 📉
### Changed
- **Convergence Dashboard**: Compressed the left outage stats panel to dynamically increase the horizontal charting space for better timeline analysis. ✨
