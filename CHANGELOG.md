## [v1.4.0-patch.68] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **maintenance** 🐳 Improved container upgrade flow by adding automatic docker system pruning (`docker system prune -a -f`) to purge unused image layers.
- **maintenance** 📊 Added real-time step-by-step progress logging of prune, pull, and recreate processes into the upgrade status view.
- **maintenance** ⚙️ Implemented dynamic recreate using `--force-recreate` with graceful fallback logic if the option is not supported.
- **maintenance** 🔌 Consolidated docker compose executable command detection into a shared utility to handle both `docker compose` and `docker-compose` layouts consistently.

## [v1.4.0-patch.67] - 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **maintenance** 🐳 Fixed the system container upgrade workflow by dynamically interpolating the version tag (`TAG=${version}`) when pulling and recreating the Docker container.
- **docker-compose** 📦 Updated the beta compose configurations (`docker-compose-latest-beta.yml` and `docker-compose-latest-beta.bridge.yml`) to use dynamic image tagging (`jsuzanne/stigix:${TAG:-latest}`) to support upgrade tag injection.

## [v1.4.0-patch.66] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🏷️ Renamed CLI command `peer` to `target` to match the Stigix Targets UI dashboard. A backward-compatible `peer` alias is preserved.
- **stigix-cli** 📡 Renamed CLI command `experience` (and its previous alias `target`) to `probes` (with `probe` and `experience` preserved as aliases) to match the Synthetic Probes UI dashboard.
- **docs** 📘 Updated `docs/STIGIX_CLI.md` with latest command definitions and documented new VyOS/IoT config import/export capabilities.
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** ⚙️ Fixed `iot start` and `iot stop` batch commands (run without argument) by dynamically querying active device IDs and sending them in the POST body to resolve the `IDs array required` backend error.

## [v1.4.0-patch.65] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 📥 Added `vyos import <file>` subcommand to import VyOS routers and sequences unified configuration from a local JSON file.
- **stigix-cli** 📤 Added `vyos export [file]` subcommand to export configured VyOS routers and sequences to a local JSON file (defaults to `vyos-config.json`).
- **stigix-cli** 🧠 Enabled autocomplete file suggestions for local `.json` files when using `vyos import` and `vyos export` commands.

## [v1.4.0-patch.64] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🔍 Added an interactive search-based category lookup for `security url` and `security dns` commands. Allows typing a search term to dynamically filter predefined categories instead of showing only the top 10.
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** 📊 Resolved a key mapping mismatch in `security results` command. The Type and Name columns now display the correct output instead of displaying `?`.

## [v1.4.0-patch.63] - 2026-05-28
### Fixed

- **stigix-cli** 🐛 Corrected configuration key parsing (`url_filtering`, `dns_security`, `threat_prevention`) in `url-batch`, `dns-batch`, and `eicar` subcommands to match the backend JSON structure.

## [v1.4.0-patch.60] - 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** 🔌 Implemented connection pooling via a global `requests.Session()` with HTTP keepalive to speed up toolbar updates, reduce socket overhead, and prevent connection drops.
- **stigix-cli** 🛡️ Wrapped the bottom toolbar rendering logic in a robust exception-handler to prevent UI freezes or lockups in prompt_toolkit during network instability or host sleep states.

## [v1.4.0-patch.59] - 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** 🎨 Fixed box alignment overflow in the Traffic Dashboard (`traffic stats` / `traffic watch`) to prevent border duplication and trailing vertical separator glitches.

### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🧠 Added `stats` subcommand to autocompletion options under `experience` and `target` commands.
- **stigix-cli** 📁 Added local `.json` file suggestions to the autocompletion menu for `import` and `export` file path inputs.
- **stigix-cli** ⚠️ Added interactive safety overwrite warnings to all `import` subcommands (`traffic`, `experience`, `peer`) to prevent accidental remote config deletion or overrides.

## [v1.4.0-patch.57] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🔌 Added support for a custom `timeout` parameter in API request helpers (`api_get`, `api_post`, `api_put`, and `api_delete`).
- **stigix-cli** 🧠 Enabled dynamic version loading in the interactive CLI start header, automatically reading from `/app/VERSION` or the root `VERSION` file, with a fallback default.
### Changed
- **stigix-cli** ⏳ Increased the `experience probe` timeout limit to 90 seconds to handle sequential testing of multiple synthetic endpoints without timing out.

## [v1.4.0-patch.56] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 📈 Implemented the `experience stats` command to display digital experience connectivity performance statistics. Draws a global experience summary banner and outputs a detailed table listing synthetic probe name, target URL/IP, type, last score (along with historical average), average latency, and reliability (uptime %).

## [v1.4.0-patch.55] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 📊 Implemented a premium terminal-based Traffic Dashboard for `traffic stats` and `traffic watch` commands. Displays running status, success rate, active apps count, total requests, total errors, real-time traffic rate (req/min & pps), and a detailed table of per-application stats (sorted by volume, resolving category group names from the backend configuration). Added a `--all` option to display the full list of active applications.

## [v1.4.0-patch.54] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🔑 Upgraded session persistence to support multi-instance token storage. The CLI now stores tokens in a URL-indexed mapping (`instance_tokens` in `~/.stigix-cli.json`), automatically restoring and preserving credentials when connecting to or switching between multiple Stigix instances.

## [v1.4.0-patch.53] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 📁 Improved CLI import/export features (`experience`, `peer`, `traffic`) by supporting standard input (passing `-` as filepath) and automatically falling back to / routing relative paths to the host-mounted `config/` directory. Added a clear instructions note about Docker environment limitations on file not found.

## [v1.4.0-patch.52] - 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** 🔌 Wrapped script module-level imports and the main execution entrypoint in a try-except block to cleanly intercept `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C) and exit with a message, preventing tracebacks.

## [v1.4.0-patch.51] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🔌 Enhanced `experience add` to support guided interactive prompting, with type-specific target/timeout defaults, and displaying the equivalent CLI command.
- **stigix-cli** 🎛️ Switched `experience list` to friendly 1-based index numbers and correctly mapped the probe targets.
- **stigix-cli** ❌ Upgraded `experience remove` to support deleting probes by index or by name.
- **stigix-cli** 💬 Integrated `shlex.split` for command tokenization to parse quoted strings correctly (e.g. `--name "My Custom Name"`).
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** 🐛 Corrected the POST endpoint payload schema for custom connectivity targets.

## [v1.4.0-patch.50] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🔌 Implemented `peer export [file]` and `peer import <file>` commands to import/export peer targets from/to JSON files.
- **stigix-cli** 🧪 Implemented `experience export [file]` and `experience import <file>` commands to import/export custom digital experience probes from/to JSON files.
- **stigix-cli** ⚡ Implemented `traffic export [file]` and `traffic import <file>` commands to import/export traffic applications/distribution configuration from/to JSON files.
- **stigix-cli** 🧠 Added tab autocomplete completions and help screen definitions for the new configuration import/export commands.

## [v1.4.0-patch.49] - 2026-05-28
### Refactored
- **stigix-cli** 🔀 Renamed the `convergence` command group to `failover` to align with the UX, while maintaining `convergence` as a backward-compatible alias.
- **stigix-cli** 🔌 Mapped the `"convergence"` peer capability to `"failover"` in the `peer list` command output, and supported both `--failover` and `--convergence` flags in `peer add`.
- **web-dashboard** 🎨 Updated the "Convergence Lab" and other user-facing UI labels, headers, and descriptions to use the "Failover" terminology.
- **docker-compose** 🐳 Updated comments mapping UDP port 6200 and describing the failover features to say "Failover probes".
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** 🐛 Fixed list-type status crash in `cmd_status` and updated the status string format.

## [v1.4.0-patch.48] - 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** 🐛 Fixed a bug in `convergence history` where Blackout and Verdict columns printed `?` for tests with 0ms max blackout due to python's falsy behavior on `0`.

## [v1.4.0-patch.47] - 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** 🐛 Fixed a crash in `convergence status` and `convergence watch` commands caused by trying to call `.get()` on a list object returned by the backend status API. It now correctly iterates over the active test status list.

## [v1.4.0-patch.46] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🔀 Enhanced `convergence start` command to query and present available Stigix targets with the `convergence` capability in a selection menu (similar to voice start and speedtest run), allowing manual IP/Host input or target name resolution (e.g. `DC1`).

## [v1.4.0-patch.45] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** ⚙️ Implemented comprehensive parameter validation and interactive prompting for speedtest options (`port`, `protocol`, `direction`, `duration`, `bitrate`, `streams`, `psk`), proposing default choices in square brackets for each option.
- **stigix-cli** 🐛 Fixed a bug in `speedtest list` where target hosts were incorrectly displayed as `?` due to an incorrect key lookup path in the job params schema.

## [v1.4.0-patch.44] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** ⚡ Enhanced `speedtest run` command to propose a list of available Stigix targets with the `xfr` capability (similar to the voice simulation target selector) or allow entering a manual IP/Host.
- **stigix-cli** 🔌 Added support for resolving friendly target names (e.g. `DC1`) specified in `speedtest run` commands to their configured host IPs.

## [v1.4.0-patch.43] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🎙️ Enhanced `voice stats` command to output a beautiful metrics dashboard consisting of an Overall QoS Summary, a Per-Target QoS Statistics table (with site mapping and quality ratings), and a detailed Call History table of recent events.
- **stigix-cli** 🎨 Refactored the `table()` utility function to be ANSI escape-aware, ensuring perfect column alignments when using color badges in table rows.

## [v1.4.0-patch.42] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🧪 Added `(Beta)` notice to interactive console start and help banners.
- **stigix-cli** 🎙️ Implemented interactive target selection/proposals and configuration auto-sync on `voice start`.
- **stigix-cli** 🔍 Added target name, host IP, and prefix matching for `peer remove/enable/disable` commands, and added an interactive deletion confirmation prompt.
- **README.md** 📊 Enhanced the post-installation verification guide with step-by-step checks including checking containers, querying system health, monitoring logs, and utilizing the CLI.
### Fixed
- **stigix-cli** 🎙️ Corrected `voice start` and `voice stop` to send `enabled: true/false` payload, fixing a bug where they inadvertently disabled the voice orchestrator.

## [v1.4.0-patch.41] - 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- **install.sh** 🐛 macOS and Windows installs were silently using `docker-compose.yml` (host networking) instead of bridge mode, despite the correct platform detection message being displayed. All three OS branches previously pointed to the same file. Fixed: macOS and WSL/Windows now correctly download `docker-compose.bridge.yml`.
- **docker-compose.bridge.yml** ✨ New dedicated bridge-mode compose file for macOS/Windows with explicit port mappings for all services (8080, 8082, 9000, 5201 TCP/UDP, 6100/6101 UDP, 6200 UDP, 3100).

## [v1.4.0-patch.40] - 2026-05-27
### Added
- **stigix-cli** 🖥️ New interactive local CLI (`Scripts/stigix-cli.py`) — full-featured terminal console for Stigix instances without browser access. Features: live bottom toolbar (auth/traffic/version status), JWT session persistence (`~/.stigix-cli.json`), named instance profiles (`connect save lab1` / `connect lab1`) for quick multi-instance switching, Tab autocompletion, command history, F1/F5/Ctrl+L shortcuts, and `traffic watch` / `convergence watch` live monitoring. Also supports `--exec` (headless single command) and `--script` (batch file) modes.
- **stigix-cli in Docker** 🐳 `stigix-cli` is now available directly inside the container — run `docker exec -it stigix stigix-cli` for zero-install local access. `prompt_toolkit` added to Python dependencies; wrapper script installed at `/usr/local/bin/stigix-cli`.
- **install-cli.sh** 📦 Improved host-side installer: auto-detects root vs user prefix (`/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin`), verifies Python 3, installs deps, checks PATH, supports `--uninstall` flag.

## [v1.4.0-patch.39] - 2026-05-22
### Changed
- **VyOS Sequences**: Implemented clickable columns for sorting in the sequence list. Columns (Name, Router, Command, Last) can now be toggled between ascending and descending order.

## [v1.4.0-patch.38] - 2026-05-22
### Fixed
- **VyOS Sequences**: Fixed an issue where the sequence execution state could get permanently "stuck" in the frontend after an action finishes (especially in loop scenarios), preventing the user from running any other sequences manually without refreshing the page. 🔄
- **VyOS Sequences**: Added an automatic 15-second retry mechanism for any sequence action that fails due to a `500 Internal Server Error` or a timeout, drastically improving reliability for intermittent connection drops. ⏳

## [v1.4.0-patch.37] - 2026-05-21
### Changed
- **VyOS Sequence & History UI**: Swapped the "Router" and "Command" columns in the Sequence list so "Router" appears first, making it consistent with the History view. Compacted the column widths in the History tab to reduce empty space and improve readability. 🔄

## [v1.4.0-patch.36] - 2026-05-21
### Changed
- **IoT Edit Modal**: Further widened the Edit Device modal from `max-w-2xl` to `max-w-3xl` (768px) to guarantee that all Attack Types and Protocols fit comfortably on a single line without any visual truncation or scrolling, even with the longest badge labels. 📱

## [v1.4.0-patch.35] - 2026-05-21
### Changed
- **IoT Edit Modal**: Widened the Edit Device modal from `max-w-xl` to `max-w-2xl` and reduced badge sizing (`px-2 py-1`, `text-[10px]`, tighter gap) so Attack Types and Protocol chips fit on a single visible line without needing to scroll. 📱

## [v1.4.0-patch.34] - 2026-05-21
### Fixed
- **IoT Edit Modal**: Applied `w-full` constraint to the horizontal scrolling containers for "Attack Types" and "Protocols" to prevent them from expanding past the form boundaries and clipping at the card border. 📱

## [v1.4.0-patch.33] - 2026-05-21
### Changed
- **VyOS Sequence Edit**: Shortened the IP address/FQDN parameter input placeholder from `"e.g. 8.8.8.8/32 or google.com"` to `"8.8.8.8/32 or FQDN"` to prevent truncation and make it fully readable in the edit dialog columns. 🔧

## [v1.4.0-patch.32] - 2026-05-21
### Added
- **Widget Search Bars**: Integrated local search bars into the four security widgets (URL Filtering, DNS Security, C2 Scenarios, and AI Security Tests) in the `Security.tsx` header blocks. Typing in the search input automatically filters matching items, restricts the "Select All" checkbox toggle action to only visible items, displays elegant empty states when no items match, and automatically expands the accordions. Implemented harmonized focus outlines per widget type (red for URL, blue for DNS, purple for C2, cyan for AI) and stopped event propagation to prevent the inputs from collapsing or expanding the accordion panels. 🔍

## [v1.4.0-patch.31] - 2026-05-21
### Added
- **Security Search Bar**: Added a dynamic autocomplete search bar at the top of the Security page (`web-dashboard/src/Security.tsx`) to search and select/enable categories and tests across URL Filtering, DNS Security, C2 Scenarios, and AI Security tests. Selecting a suggestion auto-expands the relevant accordion, enables the test, scrolls it into view, and displays a temporary glowing visual highlight. 🔍

## [v1.4.0-patch.30] - 2026-05-21
### Changed
- **IoT Edit Modal**: Redesigned the "Attack Types" and "Protocols" selections in the device configuration modal to display as single-line horizontal lists. Items do not wrap or shrink, and are scrollable with a custom-styled thin scrollbar matching the dark theme. 📱

## [v1.4.0-patch.29] - 2026-05-21
### Fixed
- **VyOS Sequence Validation**: Blocked saving a VyOS sequence in the UI if it contains a block action with an FQDN and the targeted router is running VyOS 1.4. 🛡️

## [v1.4.0-patch.28] - 2026-05-21
### Documentation
- **Changelog**: Backfilled and updated changelog entries for VyOS FQDN and description patches. 📝

## [v1.4.0-patch.27] - 2026-05-21
### Added
- **VyOS Sequence FQDN Restrictions**: Added explicit validation to strictly block FQDN usage on VyOS 1.4 routers (returns an error if attempted). FQDN blocking is now officially only supported on VyOS 1.5+.
- **VyOS Sequence Descriptions**: Restored the `description` attribute tracking (e.g., `block google.com 8.8.8.8/32`) on static blackhole routes, but specifically gated it to only execute on VyOS 1.5 routers since VyOS 1.4 does not support the description attribute on static routes.

## [v1.4.0-patch.26] - 2026-05-21
### Fixed
- **VyOS Backend**: Removed the `description` attribute from `simple-block` static routes to resolve a severe `400 BAD REQUEST` error on VyOS 1.4. VyOS 1.4 does not support descriptions on `protocols static route <prefix>`.

## [v1.4.0-patch.25] - 2026-05-21
### Fixed
- **VyOS UI**: Updated the "VyOS CLI Equivalent" text generator in the frontend. It now explicitly adds a comment noting that FQDNs (like `google.com`) are dynamically resolved into IPs by the Stigix backend, preventing user confusion when they see the FQDN directly embedded in the UI's simulated CLI output.

## [v1.4.0-patch.24] - 2026-05-21
### Added
- **VyOS Sequence FQDN Support**: The `simple-block` action now accepts FQDNs (e.g., `google.com`) in addition to IP addresses. The backend resolves the FQDN to all associated IPv4 addresses and creates blackhole routes using the route description field to store the relationship (`block google.com <IP>`). The `simple-unblock` action intelligently cleans up by matching this description rather than relying on a secondary, potentially shifted DNS resolution.
- **VyOS UI**: Updated the IP input placeholder for block/unblock actions to specify `e.g. 8.8.8.8/32 or google.com`.

## [v1.4.0-patch.23] - 2026-05-21
### Changed
- **VyOS Sequences List** (`Vyos.tsx`): Moved the "+ New Sequence" button from the global header down to the Sequences toolbar (next to Search and Sort controls). This improves ergonomics significantly on ultra-wide screens, where the centered table and right-aligned header previously created a large visual disconnect.

## [v1.4.0-patch.22] - 2026-05-21
### Fixed
- **VyOS Edit Modal** (`Vyos.tsx`): Completely replaced the custom `ActionSelector` dropdown (for selecting `Shut`, `Deny Traffic`, etc.) with a native HTML `<select>` element. The previous custom dropdown used absolute positioning which became trapped inside the modal's `overflow-y-auto` boundary, making it "impossible to scroll" or view all actions without scrolling the entire modal body. The native `<select>` effortlessly breaks out of CSS overflow constraints, providing a perfect OS-native experience.

## [v1.4.0-patch.21] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **VyOS Edit Modal** (`Vyos.tsx`): Further refined modal scrolling behavior. Added `min-h-0` to the scrolling body container to ensure the flex child is allowed to shrink below its intrinsic content height (standard CSS Flexbox fix for nested scrolling).

## [v1.4.0-patch.20] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **VyOS Sequences List** (`Vyos.tsx`): Centered the main sequences table and constrained its maximum width (`max-w-6xl mx-auto`) to prevent it from stretching uncomfortably wide on large screens.
- **VyOS Edit Modal** (`Vyos.tsx`): Fixed the modal container height constraints. Restored `overflow-hidden` and `max-h-[85vh]` on the modal wrapper, and added `min-h-0` to the scrollable `flex-1` body. This ensures the modal shrinks appropriately when it only contains one action (avoiding unnecessary empty vertical space), while correctly enabling vertical scrolling when actions exceed the screen height.

## [v1.4.0-patch.19] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **VyOS Edit Modal** (`Vyos.tsx`): Fixed scroll in actions list when adding actions to a new or existing sequence. Root cause: modal container had `max-h-[90vh]` but no explicit height, so `flex-1` inside had no real parent height to fill — replaced with `h-[82vh]` fixed height so `overflow-y-auto` on the body div works correctly.
- **VyOS Edit Modal** (`Vyos.tsx`): Narrowed modal to `max-w-3xl` (centered, less horizontal dead space). Reduced body padding (`p-5 → px-4 py-3`) and footer padding. Cancel/Save buttons more compact (`py-3 → py-2`).

## [v1.4.0-patch.18] - 2026-05-21

### Refactored
- **VyOS Sequences table** (`Vyos.tsx`): Removed accordion — all data now on a single flat line per sequence. Layout: Run button · Name+badge · Command · Router · Interface · Params · Enable toggle · Last run · Clone/Delete. Color-coded left border per command type. Clicking anywhere on the row opens the edit modal.
- **VyOS Edit Modal** (`Vyos.tsx`): Wider (`max-w-4xl`). Header bar collapsed into one horizontal strip: icon · label · Name input (flex-1) · Mode select · Duration select · Close. Removed stacked grid form in favor of the compact single-line header. Consistent `text-[12px]` font size throughout.

## [v1.4.0-patch.17] - 2026-05-21

### Refactored
- **VyOS Sequences** (`Vyos.tsx`): Replaced 3-column card grid with a compact table layout (one row per sequence). Clicking a row expands an inline accordion showing all actions (T+min, command, router, interface, params) with left-border color coding by command type. Controls (Run/Edit/Clone/Delete) use `stopPropagation` so they operate independently of the accordion toggle.
- **VyOS Sequence Edit Modal** (`Vyos.tsx`): Replaced stacked vertical action cards with a horizontal grid table (one action per row). Columns: T+min · Command · Router · Interface · Params · Delete. The Interface column is hidden (shows —) for commands that don't need it (deny-traffic, allow-traffic, clear-all-blocks, show-denied). QoS params (latency/loss/rate) display as three inline mini-inputs.

## [v1.4.0-patch.16] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **IoT Dashboard** (`Iot.tsx`): Enabled the pencil/edit action on IoT device items in list (compact) mode, matching the edit capability of grid cards.
### Changed
- **Connectivity Performance** (`ConnectivityPerformance.tsx`): Streamlined the probes list view by removing the redundant "View Details" (BarChart3) button on the right, relying entirely on row click to show the detailed modal.

## [v1.4.0-patch.15] - 2026-05-20
### Fixed
- **IoT Advanced Debug Monitor** (`Settings.tsx`, `server.ts`): Moved the historical data collection (last 6 hours / 720 points) from the frontend state to the backend memory. The UI now reliably loads the actual history of system/IoT metrics as soon as you open it, instead of starting from an empty graph and only tracking data while the tab is open.

## [v1.4.0-patch.14] - 2026-05-20
### Fixed
- **Security Modal** (`Security.tsx`): Add "Threat Prevention — Allowed" verdict panel for IPS/EICAR tests that passed. Displays target URL, HTTP response code with label, execution output (bytes downloaded), conclusion and recommended next step. Previously the modal was empty when a threat test was allowed.
- **Security Backend** (`server.ts`): Enrich scheduled EICAR test results with `url`, `command`, `http_code`, `output` and `reason` fields in both allowed and blocked cases. Previously only `{ success, status, endpoint }` was stored, leaving the modal with no data to display.

## [v1.4.0-patch.13] - 2026-05-19
### Fixed
- **IoT Import** (`server.ts`): Call `iotManager.stopAll()` before writing the new device config when importing from a Prisma CSV or Vulnerability Report CSV (non-merge mode). Previously, old devices kept running alongside new ones — when both imports used the same DHCP pool, the new devices could not obtain IP addresses. Cleanup now happens automatically at import time.

## [v1.4.0-patch.12] - 2026-05-19
### Fixed
- **IoT Daemon**: Detect duplicate MAC addresses when starting devices — auto-generate a fresh locally-administered MAC (LAA) if a collision is found, preventing `_sniff_dhcp()` race conditions that caused Vulnerability Report imported devices to never receive a DHCP OFFER when the same MACs were already active from a Device Security Asset import running concurrently.
- **IoT Daemon**: Reduce per-device stagger delay from 2 s/slot to 1 s/slot — 30 devices now boot in ~30 s instead of ~60 s.

## [v1.4.0-patch.0-docs] - 2026-05-12
### Documentation
- **IoT Simulation** 📖 Added complete documentation for `import_prisma_devices.py` in both `IOT_SIMULATION.md` (new Method 3 in device generation section) and `IOT_DEVICE_GENERATOR.md` (full dedicated section with CLI reference, bad behavior logic table, protocol mapping, DHCP fingerprint table, output format, workflow diagram, and updated 3-way comparison table).
- **IoT Simulation** 📸 Added real-world example output (163 devices CSV → 100 by risk → 64 bad-behavior) to illustrate the importer's practical value in customer demo contexts.

## [v1.4.0-patch.11] - 2026-05-19
### Fixed
- **IoT Import Modals** 📱 Wider, scrollable import dialogs for both Device Security Assets and Vulnerability Report importers:
  - `max-w-lg` → `max-w-2xl` (672px) — prevents overflow of long Prisma export filenames (e.g. `cloudsasedemo_vulnerability_detail_..._report.csv`)
  - `flex-col + max-h-[90vh]` on modal container — modal never overflows the screen
  - Content area: `overflow-y-auto` — options scroll independently of header/footer
  - Footer (Cancel / Import button): `shrink-0 + border-t` — always visible, visually separated
  - Filename: `truncate + title={file.name}` — ellipsis on long names, full name on hover

## [v1.4.0-patch.10] - 2026-05-19
### Fixed
- **IoT Import** 🏷️ MAC-address device names now resolved to human-readable profile-based names in both `import_vuln_csv.py` and `import_prisma_devices.py`:
  - `is_mac_like()`: detects `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx` pattern in Device Name field
  - `resolve_device_name()` / updated `make_name()`: fallback chain Profile → Vendor+Model → Vendor+"Device" → "IoT Device"
  - Shared `name_counters` dict per import run: same base name auto-increments (`Raspberry Pi Device #1`, `#2`, `#3`...)
  - Real non-MAC names pass through unchanged

## [v1.4.0-patch.9] - 2026-05-19
### Added
- **IoT Device Cards** 🔍 Description and vulnerability threat intel now displayed on each device card (non-compact mode):
  - **Vuln-imported devices** (`_vuln_meta`): orange threat intel panel with Danger Score badge, CVE count, severity breakdown (Critical/High), Max CVSS, APT group count, ICS-CERT warning, top CVE pills (mono font), APT group names list, OS + Site info
  - **Other devices**: description field shown as inline chip-tags (split by ` | `) or plain italic text
- **Docs** 📖 Updated `IOT_SIMULATION.md`:
  - Added Method 4 — Vulnerability Report Import with full CLI reference, Danger Score formula, expected CSV format, and UI walkthrough
  - New `behavior_type` reference table with cycle/burst/protocol details per attack type (post patch.7 tuning)
  - New Bad Behavior import modes comparison table (Auto vs All vs Percentage vs None) for both importers
  - Auto mode APT/ICS-CERT → behavior_type mapping table
  - Updated all bad behavior timing docs (beacon 10s→45s, dns_flood 15s→60s, etc.)
  - Added Example 7: Full Threat Profile (beacon + port_scan + pan_test_domains)

## [v1.4.0-patch.8] - 2026-05-19
### Added
- **IoT Simulation** 🧨 New **Vulnerability Report** import (Import → Vulnerability Report in IoT toolbar):
  - New script `iot/import_vuln_csv.py` handles Palo Alto CVE/Vulnerability CSV format (one row per CVE per device)
  - Aggregates rows by device (Device Name + IP + MAC), computes a composite **Danger Score** = Risk Score + Critical CVEs×15 + High CVEs×8 + Medium×3 + APT groups×5 + ICS-CERT×10 + Max CVSS×2
  - Selects top N devices by danger score (30 / 50 / 100 / All)
  - APT group associations drive `beacon` behavior; ICS-CERT flag drives `port_scan`; Critical/High CVEs drive `pan_test_domains`
  - Stores CVE metadata in `_vuln_meta` per device (top CVEs, APT groups, ICS flag, danger score)
  - New `POST /api/iot/import-vuln-csv` endpoint in `server.ts`
  - Orange-themed import modal with danger score formula explanation, ICS-CERT count in success banner

## [v1.4.0-patch.7] - 2026-05-19
### Performance
- **IoT Bad Behavior** ⚡ Option B — reduced Scapy raw socket load across all attack handlers to prevent D-state process accumulation under concurrent device load:
  - `dns_flood`: burst 10→**3** queries, sleep 0.5s→1s between, cycle 15s→**60s**
  - `port_scan`: sleep 0.1s→**0.5s** between ports, cycle 30s→**120s**
  - `beacon`: inter-packet 1s→2s, cycle 10s→**45s**
  - `data_exfil`: burst 5→**2** packets, sleep 0.5s→1s between, cycle 20s→**90s**
  - `pan_test_domains`: burst 5→**2** DNS queries, 3→**1** URL targets per cycle, inter-packet 1→2s, cycle 20s→**90s**
  - `random` mix: cycle 5–15s→**20–60s**

## [v1.4.0-patch.6] - 2026-05-19
### Fixed
- **IoT Simulation** 🔢 Device cards are now always sorted by their original sequence index (#1, #2, … #N) regardless of the active state filter (ALL / ACTIVE / QUEUED / IDLE / STOPPED). Previously, the display order was non-deterministic depending on which devices matched the filter.

## [v1.4.0-patch.5] - 2026-05-19
### Added
- **Settings › System** 🔍 New collapsible **IoT Advanced Debug Monitor** section, placed above the Live Docker stats. Polls every **30s** (low-overhead) and stores up to 720 data points in memory (6h coverage). Features 4 time-series charts: Device States (Active/Queued/Idle stacked area), System Health (CPU% · D-state · UDP errors), Traffic Rate (pps · ppm), and Global Experience Score + Voice MOS. Time window selector: **15m / 1h / 6h**. Purple reference lines mark `MaxConcurrent` config changes. Attack Mode (bad behavior) status shown in the toolbar. Designed to capture slow Scapy-induced degradation (D-state process blocking) correlated with concurrency settings.

## [v1.4.0-patch.4] - 2026-05-19
### Fixed
- **IoT Simulation** 🐛 Fixed a critical concurrency starvation bug where devices at the end of the list would never leave the QUEUED state. A proper FIFO queue replaces the map iteration for fairer rotation.
### Added
- **IoT Simulation** 🏷️ Added a persistent absolute device number (e.g., #12) next to each device's name in the UI to easily track devices across filters and states.

## [v1.4.0-patch.3] - 2026-05-19
### Added
- **IoT Simulation** ⏱️ Added cumulative tracking for IoT traffic and state time (Active/Queued/Idle). A beautiful segmented progress bar at the bottom of device cards replaces the old running indicator.

## [v1.4.0-patch.2] - 2026-05-19
### Changed
- **Settings** 🔧 UX: renamed Convergence to Failover in Settings menu for consistency.

## [v1.4.0-patch.1] - 2026-05-18
### Added
- **UI** 📈 Feat: synchronized crosshair + connecting line between Timing & Score charts.

## [v1.3.0-patch.104] - 2026-05-17
### Performance
- **RTP** ⚡ Perf: replace Scapy with raw UDP socket in rtp.py.

## [v1.3.0-patch.103] - 2026-05-17
### Fixed
- **RTP** 🐛 Fix: revert rtp.py audio to 30ms/33pps (was 20ms/50pps).

## [v1.3.0-patch.102] - 2026-05-17
### Added
- **Voice** 🐶 Feat: watchdog for rtp.py processes in voice_orchestrator.

## [v1.3.0-patch.101] - 2026-05-17
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🐛 Fix: use cached DHCP lease if server unreachable.

## [v1.3.0-patch.100] - 2026-05-17
### Documentation
- **IoT** 📖 Docs: refresh IOT_SIMULATION.md.

## [v1.3.0-patch.99] - 2026-05-17
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🐛 Fix: Shut and Dequeue buttons had no effect.

## [v1.3.0-patch.98] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🐛 Fix: CRITICAL — devices stuck in IDLE/QUEUED, 0 ACTIVE.

## [v1.3.0-patch.97] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **IoT** ⏱️ Feat: per-device timing info in IoT cards.

## [v1.3.0-patch.96] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🐛 Fix: remove confusing 'Cancel' button on IDLE devices.

## [v1.3.0-patch.95] - 2026-05-16

## [v1.3.0-patch.94] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🐛 Fix: 3 bugs — MAC normalization, bad behavior none, Clean Mode.

## [v1.3.0-patch.93] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🐛 Fix: IoT UI — QUEUED/IDLE devices no longer show Stopped.

## [v1.3.0-patch.92] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🐛 Fix: IoT semaphore race condition on batch start.

## [v1.3.0-patch.91] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **IoT** 🚦 Feat: IoT concurrency throttle + live system health.

## [v1.3.0-patch.90] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **Registry** 🔄 Feat: Registry hot-reload after cloud test / Prisma config save.

## [v1.3.0-patch.89] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **Cloud Target Security — Master Key TEST bug** : Après navigation (ex. Settings → Targets → retour), le champ Master Key se vidait (`cloudMasterKey = ''`). Le bouton TEST envoyait alors `masterKey: ""` au backend au lieu de `undefined`, ce qui empêchait le fallback sur la clé sauvée sur disque → HTTP 401. Fix : `cloudMasterKey.trim() || undefined` pour laisser le backend utiliser `cloud-config.json` quand le champ est vide.
- Ajout de `autoComplete="new-password"` sur l'input pour empêcher l'autofill du navigateur d'injecter une valeur incorrecte dans le champ password vide.
- Placeholder changé en "Leave empty to keep saved key" pour indiquer clairement le comportement attendu.

## [v1.3.0-patch.88] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **Global Experience Score — sélection des types de probes** : Le score global n'était calculé que sur HTTP/HTTPS et ignorait PING, DNS, UDP, TCP et CLOUD (y compris les probes Stigix Cloud). Désormais, par défaut **tous les types sont inclus**. Un nouveau bloc "Global Experience Score — Probe Types" dans Settings > Probes permet d'activer/désactiver chaque type via des boutons colorés, avec un avertissement orange si des types sont exclus.
- **`connectivity-logger.ts`** : `getStats()` accepte maintenant `globalScoreTypes[]` et filtre dynamiquement les résultats en conséquence. Le compteur HTTP Coverage reste toujours basé sur HTTP/HTTPS uniquement.
- **`server.ts`** : L'API `/api/config/ui` GET et POST supporte maintenant `globalScoreTypes`. Le endpoint `/api/connectivity/stats` lit les types depuis `ui-config.json` et les passe à `getStats()`.

## [v1.3.0-patch.87] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **Settings.tsx** ⚠️ Validation non-bloquante (Option B) : un badge orange "Not tested" apparaît dans le header Cloud Target Security et un avertissement sous "Save Configuration" de Prisma SASE dès qu'un champ est modifié sans avoir cliqué "Test". Le badge disparaît automatiquement après un test réussi. La sauvegarde reste toujours possible.

## [v1.3.0-patch.86] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **server.ts** 🔗 Normalisation automatique de l'URL du Cloudflare Worker : `https://` est ajouté si absent (ex: `target.stigix.io` → `https://target.stigix.io`), évitant l'erreur "Invalid URL" lors du test de connexion.

## [v1.3.0-patch.85] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **server.ts** 🔧 Les endpoints de test `/api/config/cloud/test` et `/api/security/config/test` lisent maintenant les credentials sauvegardés sur disque (`cloud-config.json`, `prisma-config.json`) comme fallback, résolvant le "Network error" quand aucun champ n'est modifié dans l'UI.
- **server.ts** 🐛 Ajout d'un timeout explicite (`AbortSignal.timeout(10000)`) sur le test Cloudflare Worker. Amélioration du parsing d'erreur Prisma (recherche dans stdout + stderr, détection `ModuleNotFoundError`).

## [v1.3.0-patch.84] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **Settings.tsx & server.ts** 🔐 Ajout de la validation des "Stigix Master Key" et identifiants "Prisma SASE".
- **Settings.tsx** 🚀 Intégration de boutons "Test" pour vérifier la validité de la clé maître auprès du worker Cloudflare et l'authentification Prisma SASE via `getflow.py`.

## [v1.3.0-patch.83] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **ConnectivityPerformance.tsx** 🎯 Alignement horizontal des graphes Score Over Time et Timing Analysis : les deux axes Y gauches ont maintenant width=50 identique, les zones de dessin démarrent au même pixel.

## [v1.3.0-patch.82] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **ConnectivityPerformance.tsx** 📈 Global Experience Over Time : carte full-width avec tabs 15m/1H/6H/24H/7D, AreaChart du score global buckété par période, placée entre les KPI et Performance Trends. Le sélecteur de période est partagé avec le reste de la vue.
- **ConnectivityPerformance.tsx** 📊 Per-probe Score Over Time : dans le modal de détail, nouveau graphe LineChart dual-axe (Score couleur type + Latency orange dashed), avec tabs 1H/6H/24H indépendants, placé avant Recent Captures.

## [v1.3.0-patch.81] - 2026-05-16
### Documentation
- **README.md** Version badge mis à jour v1.3.0-patch.80. Ajout de State Persistence dans Features et What's New highlights.
- **docs/IOT_SIMULATION.md** Nouvelle section "State Persistence" : table start/stop → enabled flag → effect at boot.
- **docs/VOICE_SIMULATION.md** Mise à jour "Clean Slate Architecture" → conditionnel selon le toggle State Persistence. Nouvelle section State Persistence.

## [v1.3.0-patch.80] - 2026-05-16
### Improved
- **Settings.tsx** 🏷️ Renomme "Startup Behaviour / Auto-restart" en "State Persistence / Preserve service state across reboots". Les descriptions de chaque toggle reflètent la vraie sémantique : les services reprennent leur état d'avant le reboot, ils ne démarrent pas tous automatiquement.

## [v1.3.0-patch.79] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **server.ts** 🔄 IoT auto-restart on boot now respects the last running state. Start/stop routes (single + batch) now persist `enabled: true/false` in `iot-devices.json`. The boot hook only restarts devices that were actually running (enabled:true) before the shutdown, consistent with Voice behavior.

## [v1.3.0-patch.78] - 2026-05-16
### Improved
- **Settings.tsx** 🔧 4 toggles Startup Behaviour (Traffic, Probes, IoT, Voice) en grille 2x2. Traffic et Probes actifs par defaut (retrocompat). Redesign dark mode : card sobre avec border-border, textes text-text-primary/secondary, lisibles en dark et light mode.
- **Settings.tsx** 🐛 Fix check validite Voice : l'API retourne servers comme une string brute (et non un tableau). Le toggle Voice se debloque maintenant correctement si des serveurs sont configures.
- **server.ts** 🔒 auto_restart_traffic (defaut: true) et auto_restart_probes (defaut: true) dans system-settings.json. Gate startConnectivityMonitor() et traffic force-disable au boot selon les flags.

## [v1.3.0-patch.77] - 2026-05-16
### Improved
- **Settings.tsx** 🔒 Les toggles "Startup Behaviour" (IoT + Voice) sont désormais désactivés avec un message explicatif si aucune configuration valide n'existe (aucun device IoT activé, aucun serveur Voice configuré). Le toggle reste cliquable uniquement si la config est présente et valide. Pendant le chargement, le toggle est en état "pulse" (loading).

## [v1.3.0-patch.76] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **system-settings.json** 🆕 Nouveau fichier de settings système dédié (`config/system-settings.json`), rétrocompatible (si absent → defaults false = comportement actuel).
- **Settings.tsx** ⚡ Section "Startup Behaviour" proéminente dans l'onglet System Info : 2 toggles pour activer l'auto-restart IoT et Voice au boot.
- **server.ts** 🔄 Hook de démarrage : si `auto_restart_iot=true`, démarre automatiquement les devices IoT activés 15s après le boot du container.
- **voice_orchestrator.py** 🔄 Respect du flag `auto_restart_voice` : ne force plus `enabled=false` au boot si le paramètre est actif, permettant la reprise des appels voix.
- **server.ts** 🛣️ Nouvelles routes `GET/POST /api/config/system-settings`.

## [v1.3.0-patch.75] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **iot_emulator.py** 📋 Persistance des baux DHCP (RFC 2131 INIT-REBOOT) : chaque IP obtenue par DHCP est sauvegardée dans `/app/config/dhcp_leases.json` (volume persistant Docker).
- **iot_emulator.py** 🔄 Au redémarrage du container, le device tente de reclaimer la même IP via un REQUEST direct (sans DISCOVER) — si le serveur DHCP accepte, même IP garantie.
- **iot_emulator.py** 🛡️ Si le serveur NAK ou ne répond pas (IP hors subnet), fallback automatique sur le DISCOVER classique.
- **iot_emulator.py** 🔒 Si le device n'avait jamais eu d'IP, aucune lease n'est sauvée : comportement inchangé.

## [v1.3.0-patch.74] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- **ConnectivityPerformance.tsx** 🐛 Le filtre TimeRange fonctionne maintenant réellement : la limite API est désormais dynamique selon la plage (15m=300, 1h=1500, 6h=5000, 24h=12000, 7d=30000).
- **ConnectivityPerformance.tsx** 🗑️ Suppression des boutons graphTimeRange morts (jamais connectés aux données).
- **connectivity-logger.ts** 🐛 Ajout du case manquant '15m' dans getResults() (existait dans getStats mais pas dans getResults).
- **ConnectivityPerformance.tsx** ⚡ Plage par défaut changée de '24h' à '1h' pour un chargement initial plus rapide.

## [v1.3.0-patch.73] - 2026-05-15
### Changed
- **Iot.tsx** 🗑️ Suppression du widget "Scale & Monitoring" — bruit visuel inutile.
- **Iot.tsx** 📐 Correction de l'alignement du header (min-w-0, flex-shrink, whitespace-nowrap sur les liens).

## [v1.3.0-patch.72] - 2026-05-15
### Fixed
- **Iot.tsx** 🎯 Correction de l'alignement de la barre de sélection dans l'en-tête (flex-shrink-0 + whitespace-nowrap).
- **Iot.tsx** 🔵 Agrandissement du bouton Start/Shut sur les cartes d'appareils (py-3.5, text-sm, Power size=18).

## [v1.3.0-patch.71] - 2026-05-15
### Fixed
- **voice_orchestrator.py** ⏱️ Correction du calcul de `num_packets` pour utiliser l'intervalle de 20ms (0.02s) — les appels durent maintenant exactement la durée configurée.
- **voice_orchestrator.py** 🔧 Passage du paramètre `--stream-type` à `rtp.py` depuis la configuration serveur.

## [v1.3.0-patch.70] - 2026-05-15
### Fixed
- **rtp.py** 🐛 Correction de l'erreur `AttributeError: ssrc` (Scapy utilise le nom de paramètre `sourcesync` au lieu de `ssrc`).

## [v1.3.0-patch.69] - 2026-05-15
### Fixed
- **rtp.py** 🛠️ Correction critique de la gestion des timestamps RTP (incrément de 160 pour l'audio, 900 pour la vidéo) pour la conformité App-ID.
- **rtp.py** 🎲 Randomisation du SSRC pour simuler un véritable équipement de téléphonie/vidéo.

## [v1.3.0-patch.68] - 2026-05-15
### Improved
- **rtp.py** 🎙️ Optimisation du flux audio par défaut (20ms / 160 octets) pour une meilleure reconnaissance App-ID (rtp-audio).
- **rtp.py** 📹 Ajout du support expérimental pour la simulation de flux vidéo (--stream-type video).
- **rtp.py** ⚙️ Calcul dynamique des longueurs d'en-tête IP/UDP pour une conformité protocolaire parfaite.

## [v1.3.0-patch.67] - 2026-05-15
### Documentation
- **IoT Simulation** 📚 Mise à jour de la documentation avec les nouvelles captures d'écran de l'interface d'import.
- **IoT Simulation** 📖 Amélioration du guide d'importation des actifs Device Security.

## [v1.3.0-patch.66] - 2026-05-15
### Changed
- **IoT Simulation** 🤖 Refonte de l'interface d'importation : regroupement des actions dans un menu déroulant unique.
- **IoT Simulation** 📄 Clarification de l'import CSV (Palo Alto Device Security) avec des descriptions détaillées pour guider l'utilisateur.
- **UI/UX** ✨ Amélioration des animations et de la structure visuelle de la barre d'outils IoT.

## [v1.3.0-patch.65] - 2026-05-15
### Fixed
- **rtp.py** 📞 Correction d'un bug d'affichage dans les logs : le port source affichait `31000+N` alors que le code utilisait bien `30000+N`.
- **rtp.py** 🧹 Nettoyage du code source (suppression des blocs commentés obsolètes) et ajout de logs de debug pour la dérivation du port source via le CALL-ID.

## [v1.3.0-patch.64] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **ConnectivityPerformance** 📊 Le graphe de décomposition de latence dans le modal de détail d'un probe utilisait `slice(0, 30)` en dur — remplacé par `slice(0, maxCaptures)` pour respecter le paramètre "Number of Recent Captures" configuré dans Settings
- **Settings** 📝 Texte de la section "History Display Settings" clarifié : précise maintenant que le slider contrôle la table ET le graphe du modal, et que la fréquence des probes (1 min) est fixée côté serveur et ne peut pas être changée depuis l'UI

## [v1.3.0-patch.63] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **Security History** 🏷️ Dropdown filter renommé : options désormais `URL Filtering`, `DNS Security`, `Threat Prevention`, `C2 Scenario`, `AI Security` et `All Types` (plus clair que `URL Lists` etc.)
- **Security History** 📊 Colonne `Change` renommée en `Delta` — reflète mieux le contenu (variation de statut entre deux runs)
- **URL Test Modal** 🔍 Panel verdict enrichi pour les URL filtering tests :
  - **Allowed** : confirme le code HTTP, indique si la vraie page PANDB Palo Alto a été servie, message rassurant
  - **Blocked** : code HTTP reçu, mécanisme de blocage (in-band block page vs policy drop), catégorie concernée, Next Step vers les logs NGFW

## [v1.3.0-patch.62] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **VyOS History CLI** 🐛 Correction du CLI généré pour `deny-traffic` / `allow-traffic` / `clear-all-blocks` : le mécanisme réel utilise des **routes blackhole statiques avec tag 999** (et non des règles firewall). Les commandes affichées sont maintenant :
  - Block : `set protocols static route <prefix> blackhole tag 999`
  - Unblock : `delete protocols static route <prefix>`
  - Clear all : `delete protocols static route <prefix>` (une par route)

## [v1.3.0-patch.61] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **VyOS History** 🖥️ CLI accordion expand: click any row in the History table to reveal a dark terminal panel with the exact VyOS CLI commands pushed. Works in both flat and grouped views.
  - New entries store `cli_equivalent` directly in `vyos-history.jsonl` (backend fix in `vyos-scheduler.ts`).
  - Legacy entries (pre-patch.61) fall back to client-side CLI generation from `command + interface + parameters` via `generateCliEquivalent()`.
  - Subtle `>_` indicator on each row lights up cyan when the terminal is open.
  - COPY button clips the commands to clipboard without closing the accordion.

## [v1.3.0-patch.60] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Settings** 📊 Traffic Distribution Overview: redesigned as **dual-zone bar**. Left zone (w-24, fixed) = blue gradient gauge normalized to the heaviest category — preserves visual comparison between groups. Right zone (flex-1) = always 100% filled with app icons/names — zero wasted gray space. The % label moves inside the gauge. Header hint "◀ weight · apps ▶" explains the two zones.

## [v1.3.0-patch.59] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Docs** 🖼️ Reduced screenshot sizes in `docs/IOT_SIMULATION.md` for better readability.

## [v1.3.0-patch.58] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Settings** 📐 Traffic Distribution Overview: reverted 2-column grid in favour of **maximised single-column bars** — label column narrowed `w-56` → `w-32` (128px) giving bars ~80% more horizontal room. Bar height raised `h-5` → `h-7`. App label threshold lowered (icon+text visible at >12% instead of >18%, icon-only at >3% instead of >6%) so more apps show their favicon and name directly in the bar.

## [v1.3.0-patch.57] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Settings** 📐 Traffic Distribution Overview: switched from single-column list to **2-column grid** layout. Reduces vertical space by ~50% (from 17 full-width rows to 9 rows × 2 columns). Label column narrowed from `w-56` → `w-40`, bar height `h-6` → `h-5`, row gap tightened.

## [v1.3.0-patch.56] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **IoT** 🏷️ Renamed "Import Prisma CSV" button to **"IoT Security CSV"** — clearer reference to the actual Palo Alto product (Prisma Access → Device Security → IoT Security). Updated button label, modal title, and doc.

## [v1.3.0-patch.55] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **IoT** 🧬 Prisma CSV import — three enrichment improvements to `import_prisma_devices.py`:
  1. **OS-aware DHCP fingerprinting**: added `OS_DHCP_FINGERPRINTS` dict (Windows → `MSFT 5.0`, iOS → `dhcpcd-9.4.1`, Linux/Embedded → `udhcp`, Enea OSE, FortiOS, macOS). OS fingerprint overrides vendor-based default when `os group` or `OS` column is populated.
  2. **Fix protocol column**: switched from `display_apps` (always empty in real exports) to `Applications` → `display_apps` → `display_protos` fallback chain. Devices now get much richer protocol sets.
  3. **Asset Criticality as secondary bad-behavior signal**: when `ml_risk_level` is missing, `Asset Criticality = Critical|High` triggers bad behavior.
  4. **Enriched description**: now includes OS, risk level, criticality, wire/wireless, and VLAN info.
### Changed
- **Docs** 📖 Updated `docs/IOT_SIMULATION.md` Prisma CSV Import section to document OS-aware DHCP, UI import button, enriched description, and correct CLI examples.

## [v1.3.0-patch.54] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🔤 Prisma CSV import: fixed vendor name duplication in generated device names ("HP HP Computer" → "HP Computer", "Atlas Atlas Copco" → "Atlas Copco Torque Controller"). Added `make_name()` helper that checks if the model string already starts with the vendor first-word (case-insensitive, ignoring punctuation like commas) before prepending it.

## [v1.3.0-patch.53] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **IoT** 🐛 Prisma CSV import: script path now uses `PROJECT_ROOT` (same mechanism as other Python scripts) instead of `__dirname`-relative path. Fixes `No such file or directory` error in Docker where `__dirname = /app` and `../iot/` resolved to `/iot/` instead of `/app/iot/`.

## [v1.3.0-patch.52] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **IoT** 📥 New **Import Prisma CSV** button in the IoT Simulation header. Uploads a Prisma Access / IoT Security device export CSV, runs `import_prisma_devices.py` server-side, and imports the resulting devices directly — no manual CLI steps required. Options: max devices (30/50/100/All), IoT-only filter, bad behavior mode (Auto from risk level / All / Percentage / None), and Merge vs Replace. Includes client-side CSV header validation to detect invalid or wrong file format before the backend is called.

## [v1.3.0-patch.51] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Targets** 🐛 Fixed infinite re-appear cycle when deleting a target that was also present in `convergence-endpoints.json` or `voice-config.json`. `deleteTarget()` now removes the host directly from those source files instead of relying on a "promote + disable" workaround that users could break by deleting the disabled entry. The promote+disable path is preserved only for registry (`reg-*`) and env-var-derived targets that cannot be edited locally.

## [v1.3.0-patch.50] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **IoT** 📐 Device cards in the grid view now maintain consistent height whether or not bad behavior badges are shown. The behavior badge container always renders with `min-h-[22px]`, preventing the Start button from shifting down on cards with active attack types.

## [v1.3.0-patch.49] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Registry** 🛡️ Defense-in-depth self-exclusion in `getPeers()` — node now explicitly skips its own `instance_id` from the peer cache, regardless of whether the registry (local or Cloudflare) filtered it out. Prevents inflated `peer_count`, loopback XFR/Voice/Convergence tests, and self-loops in the topology view.

## [v1.3.0-patch.48] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Traffic Control** 🌐 Renamed `Speedtest` button to `Internet Speedtest` and replaced the `Gauge` icon with `Globe` to clearly distinguish it from the XFR/iperf internal bandwidth test.

## [v1.3.0-patch.47] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **Traffic Control** ⚡ Added a `Configure Distribution` shortcut button below the Traffic Generation status line. Clicking it deep-links directly to Settings → Traffic Distribution — same mechanism as the "Manage Probes" button.

## [v1.3.0-patch.46] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Traffic Distribution** 📐 Distribution Overview panel now wrapped in `max-w-7xl mx-auto` to align with the slider blocks below it. Group name column widened from `w-40` (160px) to `w-56` (224px) to prevent truncation of long category names.

## [v1.3.0-patch.45] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **Traffic Distribution** 🗂️ Category groups are now collapsible — click the header to fold/unfold. App count badge visible in header even when collapsed. Chevron rotates on state change.
### Fixed
- **Traffic Distribution** 🔓 Removed the artificial 4-app limit per group. All apps now render with individual sliders regardless of group size.

## [v1.3.0-patch.44] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Build** 🐛 Docker build failure: `Cannot find name 'BarChart3'` — added missing `BarChart3` import from `lucide-react` in `Settings.tsx`.

## [v1.3.0-patch.43] - 2026-05-13
### Added
- **Traffic Distribution** 📊 New **Distribution Overview** panel above the sliders — one compact row per category showing a stacked horizontal bar. Each segment is proportional to the app's global traffic weight, displays the app favicon + domain name (adaptive to segment width), and shows a tooltip with exact % on hover.

## [v1.3.0-patch.42] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **Navigation UX** 🧭 The "Manage Probes" button in Digital Experience now correctly selects the **Synthetic Probes** sub-menu when navigating to Settings, instead of defaulting to Traffic Distribution.

## [v1.3.0-patch.41] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- **Security Dashboard** 🏷️ Unified all test verdict labels under a single vocabulary: `Blocked` / `Allowed` / `Inconclusive` — applies to URL Filtering, DNS Security, EICAR, C2 Scenarios, and AI Security tests.
  - `Enforced` (C2/AI) → displayed as **Blocked** (red)
  - `Bypass` (C2/AI) → displayed as **Allowed** (green)
  - `Inconclusive` and `Completed` added as proper states in the unified `getStatusBadge` component
  - Removed `getAIVerdictBadge` / `getC2VerdictBadge` — all test types now use a single `getStatusBadge`
  - Fixed "Bypass" label in EICAR statistics card and Cloud probe summary → now reads "Allowed"
  - Toast notifications for C2/AI results updated accordingly
- **docs/SECURITY_TESTING.md** 📖 Updated all verdict tables and descriptions to reflect the new Blocked/Allowed vocabulary.

## [v1.3.0-patch.40] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- **URL Filtering Tests** 🔍 Added `preDnsCheck` pre-resolution step before every curl URL test. A fast `nslookup -timeout=4` now runs first; if the hostname is unresolvable (NXDOMAIN or DNS timeout), the test immediately returns `dns_error` without launching curl. This eliminates the "first test = misleading 10s CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, second test = correct DNS_RESOLUTION_FAILURE" artifact caused by slow first-query DNS proxy resolution in the container.

## [v1.3.0-patch.39] - 2026-05-12
### Added
- **Security Dashboard** 🔗 The "Requires STIGIX_TARGET_MASTER_KEY" warning on the Stigix Cloud EICAR target is now a clickable link. Clicking it navigates directly to Settings → Cloud Target Security and auto-scrolls to the key configuration panel, eliminating the need for manual navigation.

## [v1.3.0-patch.38] - 2026-05-12
### Changed
- **UI Readability** 🎨 Proportional font scale: bumped base `font-size` from `16px` to `17px` so all rem-based Tailwind sizes (text-xs, text-sm, text-base, KPI numbers) scale ~6% together. Added CSS overrides for hardcoded pixel sizes (`text-[9px]` → 10px, `text-[10px]` → 11px, `text-[11px]` → 12px) to preserve visual hierarchy across widget labels.

## [v1.3.0-patch.37] - 2026-05-12
### Changed
- **UI Readability** 🎨 Dark-mode contrast improvements: brightened `--text-muted` CSS token (from `#64748b` to `#7c8fa8`) for improved legibility of secondary labels. Updated font stack to use native system fonts (SF Pro on macOS, Segoe UI on Windows) for sharper text rendering. Navigation tabs bumped from `text-xs` (12px) to `text-sm` (14px). Accent pills and active tab colors updated to `blue-300`/`purple-300` variants for better contrast on dark backgrounds.

## [v1.3.0-patch.36] - 2026-05-12
### Changed
- **Security Dashboard** 🏷️ Renamed test history table headers for better semantic clarity: "Test #" → "Type" (showing URL/DNS/EICAR/C2/AI badge), "Disposition" → "Result" for more intuitive reading of test outcomes.

## [v1.3.0-patch.35] - 2026-05-12
### Fixed
- **Deploy** 🐛 Corrected `COMPOSE_URL` override in `install-latest-beta.sh` to point to the correct beta compose file instead of the production stable one.

## [v1.3.0-patch.34] - 2026-05-12
### Added
- **Deploy** 🧪 New `install-latest-beta.sh` script for testing pre-release deployments. Uses the `latest` Docker image tag and a dedicated beta compose file to allow safe testing of new features before stable promotion.
### Fixed
- **Deploy** 🔑 Applied `JWT_SECRET` auto-generation fix to `install.sh` to prevent fresh installs from using an empty or default secret.

## [v1.3.0-patch.33] - 2026-05-12
### Fixed
- **Security** 🛡️ Resolved a false-positive "offline" status for EICAR targets. Reachability checks now use the UDP convergence port instead of a generic HTTP probe, eliminating incorrect offline classification for EICAR cloud targets.

## [v1.3.0-patch.32] - 2026-05-11
### Documentation
- **Changelog** 📝 Backfilled CHANGELOG with all patches since `patch.16`, bringing the release history up to date.

## [v1.3.0-patch.31] - 2026-05-11
### Changed
- **IoT Simulation** 🔧 Replaced dynamic local sample generation with a direct download link to a clean, centralized `iot-devices.json` configuration file hosted on GitHub.

## [v1.3.0-patch.30] - 2026-05-11
### Fixed
- **IoT Simulation** 🧹 Sanitized IoT device persistence logic: runtime states (`running` flags and raw execution logs) are now automatically stripped before saving or exporting configurations, preventing config file bloat and import issues.

## [v1.3.0-patch.29] - 2026-05-11
### Refactored
- **IoT Simulation** 🔄 Replaced dynamic local sample generation with a direct GitHub download link for the sample `iot-devices.json`. Renamed the uploaded sample config for clarity.

## [v1.3.0-patch.28] - 2026-05-11
### Added
- **Security Dashboard** ⚠️ Added visual warnings and disabled Cloud EICAR targets when the `STIGIX_TARGET_MASTER_KEY` environment variable is missing, preventing silent execution failures.

## [v1.3.0-patch.27] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **System** 🐛 Resolved a critical Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) startup crash on fresh installations caused by uninitialized path references in the `fs.writeFileSync` interceptor.

## [v1.3.0-patch.26] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Dashboard** 🎨 Cleaned up test detail modal typography: consistent `curl` command display formatting and removed excessive uppercase styling from modal content.

## [v1.3.0-patch.25] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Dashboard** 🧹 Removed duplicate "Disposition Reasoning" block that appeared twice in the Security Test Details modal.

## [v1.3.0-patch.24] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Dashboard** 🔡 Removed `text-transform: uppercase` from modal content in Security test details for improved readability of long URLs and hostnames.

## [v1.3.0-patch.23] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Dashboard** 🔧 Enriched URL test diagnostic views with explicit `curl` error classification (connection refused, timeout, SSL error, HTTP code) and consistent curl command string display in the execution log.

## [v1.3.0-patch.22] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **Security Dashboard** 📤 Introduced full Import and Export capabilities for Security Profiles, enabling backup and transfer of custom testing catalogs between Stigix instances.

## [v1.3.0-patch.21] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Framework** 🛡️ Used `EMBEDDED_SECURITY_PROFILE` as fallback in `getSecurityProfile()` when the JSON file is missing or corrupted, preventing a blank security profile on upgrade.

## [v1.3.0-patch.20] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Framework** 🔄 Force-overwrite `security-profile.json` if the file exists but is empty or malformed (e.g. after a failed upgrade), ensuring a valid catalog is always present.

## [v1.3.0-patch.19] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Framework** 🐛 Fixed a `TDZ ReferenceError` (`Cannot access 'X' before initialization`) in `ensureSecurityProfile()` caused by a circular import ordering issue on Node.js startup.

## [v1.3.0-patch.18] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Security Framework** 🔁 Added automatic `security-profile.json` generation on container upgrade: if the file is absent (first install or upgrade from older version), it is bootstrapped from the embedded catalog without requiring a manual reset.

## [v1.3.0-patch.17] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **Security Framework** ⚙️ Phase 1 — Externalized the previously hardcoded security test catalog into a standalone `security-profile.json` file. Enables per-instance customization of test targets, categories, and expected verdicts without rebuilding the image.
### Documentation
- **Documentation** 📖 Added a comprehensive Azure deployment guide (`AZURE_INSTALL.md`) covering VM sizing, NSG rules, Docker setup, and one-liner install.

## [v1.3.0-patch.16] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **Documentation Overhaul** 📖 Massive visual update across all core modules:
    - **Convergence Lab**: Added 5 high-fidelity screenshots documenting live failover monitoring and historical timeline deep-dives.
    - **IoT Simulation**: Added 4 screenshots covering the new device gallery, bad behavior configuration, and real-time Scapy logs.
    - **VoIP Simulation**: Added 4 screenshots illustrating the deterministic source port mapping (31000+) and per-target QoS statistics.
    - **VyOS Control**: Added 6 screenshots showcasing automated impairment missions, sequence editing, and live mission timelines.
- **Documentation Style** 🎨 Harmonized all visual assets with descriptive, premium-style captions for improved technical clarity.
- **README** 📊 Updated Statistics and VoIP counts in the main project gallery to reflect the new documentation depth.

## [v1.3.0-patch.15] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **Network Status** 🌍 Added a country flag emoji next to the Public IP address in the Network Status widget, derived from a geo-IP lookup, for instant visual identification of the egress region.

## [v1.3.0-patch.14] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 🎨 Fixed vertical alignment of `TYPE` and `STATUS` badge elements in the Connectivity probes table so they align consistently across all row heights.

## [v1.3.0-patch.13] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 📐 Fixed text alignment of metrics values (Avg/Min/Max scores) displayed in the Last Score column to ensure consistent right-alignment and prevent visual misalignment on varying screen widths.

## [v1.3.0-patch.12] - 2026-05-10
### Changed
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 📈 Displayed the `Avg`, `Min`, and `Max` scores directly under the `Last Score` column in the main probes table for immediate visibility.


## [v1.3.0-patch.11] - 2026-05-10
### Changed
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 🎨 Improved the Probe detail modal:
  - Hidden HTTP-specific timing columns (DNS, TCP, TLS, TTFB, HTTP Code) for non-HTTP/CLOUD probes (e.g., PING, UDP) for a cleaner UI.
  - Added a distinct probe type badge directly in the modal title.
  - The entire row in the main dashboard table is now clickable to open probe details.
  - Renamed "Manage Endpoints" button to "Manage Probes".
- **Connectivity Dashboard** 📊 Added underlying data model tracking for minimum and maximum probe scores to support future notification triggers.

## [v1.3.0-patch.10] - 2026-05-09
### Fixed
- **VyOS Engine** 🛡️ Added a fallback mechanism for `deny-traffic` (simple-block) to automatically support mixed fleets of VyOS devices. If a router rejects the modern VyOS 1.4/1.5 syntax (tag as a child of blackhole), the engine will seamlessly catch the 400 error and retry with the legacy syntax (tag as a sibling of blackhole).

## [v1.3.0-patch.9] - 2026-05-09
### Fixed
- **VyOS Engine** 🐛 Fixed an issue where `deny-traffic` (simple-block) failed on newer VyOS versions (1.4/1.5) with a `400 Bad Request`. The API payload now correctly places the `tag` node as a child of the `blackhole` node instead of a sibling, aligning with the updated VyOS CLI syntax.

## [v1.3.0-patch.8] - 2026-05-09
### Changed
- **Security Dashboard** 🎨 Added a "BETA" badge to the **C2 Attack Scenarios** and **AI Security Tests** panels to indicate their new status.
- **Security Dashboard** 📏 Fixed header alignment in the AI Security Tests and C2 Attack Scenarios panels for better visual consistency.

## [v1.3.0-patch.7] - 2026-05-09
### Changed
- **Security Dashboard** 🎨 Refined the detailed test result modal:
    - Renamed **Telemetry Diagnostic** to **Security Test Details** for better clarity.
    - Renamed **Detailed Observation Log** to **Detailed Execution Log**.
    - Renamed **Diagnostic Error Signature** to **Test Error Signature**.
    - Renamed **Cloud Diagnostic** to **Cloud Execution Context**.
    - Renamed the footer button to **Close Details**.
- **Security Dashboard** 🧹 Cleaned up typography and spacing in the detail modal headers.

## [v1.3.0-patch.6] - 2026-05-08
### Added
- **AI Security Tests** 🤖 New dedicated **AI Security** panel in the Security dashboard mirroring the Palo Alto AISA PowerShell simulation script. Includes 5 scenarios: DLP Credit Card extraction, Prompt Injection/Jailbreak, Misfortune Cookie (CVE-2014-9222), EICAR Malware Upload to AI apps, and Volume Traffic Generator (24 AI apps across 6 categories). 🚀
- **AI Security Backend** `POST /api/security/ai-test` and `POST /api/security/ai-test-batch` routes — each scenario runs `curl` against live AI app endpoints (ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, Perplexity) and aggregates verdicts across all targets.
- **AI Security Scheduler** ⏰ Configurable periodic scheduler for AI Security scenarios — identical to DNS/URL/C2 scheduler controls. Config key: `scheduled_execution.ai`.
- **Verdict System** `Enforced` (green) / `Bypass` (red) / `Completed` (cyan, volume test only) / `Inconclusive` (orange) — inverted logic consistent with C2 module.
- **Security Log** 🏷️ `AIS` badge type (cyan) in the Security Test Log; `AI Security` filter option in the history dropdown.
- **shared/security-categories.ts** `AI_SECURITY_SCENARIOS`, `AI_PRIORITY_APPS`, `AI_VOLUME_APPS` exports with `AISecurityScenario` interface.
- **test-logger.ts** Extended `TestResult` to support `type:'ai'` and status `'completed'`; updated `LogStats` stats counters.
### Documentation
- **docs/SECURITY_TESTING.md** (v3.1) Comprehensive **AI Security Tests** section documenting all 5 scenarios with exact execution sequences, PowerShell script equivalents, verdict rules, troubleshooting guides, and SSL Inspection requirements. 📖

## [v1.3.0-patch.5] - 2026-05-08
### Fixed
- **Build** 🐛 Docker build failed with `TS2304: Cannot find name 'SchedulerControl'` — renamed to the correct `SchedulerSettings` component and widened its `type` prop union to include `'c2'`. Previously the C2 scheduler panel referenced a non-existent component name.
- **Security.tsx** Widened `updateSchedule` function type from `'url' | 'dns' | 'threat'` to `'url' | 'dns' | 'threat' | 'c2'` to resolve implicit `any` TypeScript errors on C2 scheduler callbacks.

## [v1.3.0-patch.4] - 2026-05-08
### Fixed
- **Security Log** 🐛 C2 entries now show badge `C2S` (was incorrectly showing `THREAT`) — root cause: `TestLogger` was receiving `type:'threat'` instead of `type:'c2'` for all c2_scenario entries
- **Security Log** 🐛 C2 disposition now shows `Enforced` / `Bypass` / `Inconclusive` (was showing `Unknown`) — root cause: `TestResult.status` type union didn't include C2 verdict values, and `result` object wasn't reconstructed with full details from logger
- **Test Logger** Extended `TestResult` interface to support `type:'c2'` and status values `'enforced' | 'bypass' | 'inconclusive'`; updated `LogStats` accordingly

### Added
- **C2 Panel** ⏰ C2 Scheduler — configurable interval (5/10/15/30/45/60m) + enable toggle + next run time display, identical to DNS and URL scheduler controls
- **Backend** Scheduled C2 runner (`runScheduledC2Tests`) fires all 7 scenarios sequentially on the configured interval; integrated into `startSchedulers()` with 800ms inter-test delay
- **Backend** `scheduled_execution.c2` added to `DEFAULT_SECURITY_CONFIG` and auto-migration guard for existing configs

## [v1.3.0-patch.3] - 2026-05-08
### Added
- **Security Dashboard** 📋 C2 scenario cards now show the last verdict badge inline (Enforced/Bypass/Inconclusive) — same behavior as DNS and URL cards in the screenshot.
- **Backend** 🔍 Each C2 scenario now produces a detailed step-by-step sequence log in `details.output`, visible in the Telemetry Diagnostic modal. Includes exact command, intent, engine, raw output, and verdict decision per step.
- **Documentation** 📖 New comprehensive `C2 Attack Scenarios` section in `docs/SECURITY_TESTING.md` (v3.0): exact test sequence, PowerShell equivalents, verdict rules tables, per-scenario firewall engine requirements, and full troubleshooting guide for each of the 7 scenarios.

## [v1.3.0-patch.2] - 2026-05-08
### Added
- **Security Dashboard** 🎯 New **C2 Attack Scenarios** panel in the Security page, reproducing the exact 7-step Prisma Access security simulation script (SQL Injection, DNS C2 Infiltration, Greyware DNS, Compromised DNS, Sliver C2 Emulation, EICAR over HTTPS, DNS Tunneling Burst).
- **Backend** 🔌 Two new API routes: `POST /api/security/c2-test` (individual scenario) and `POST /api/security/c2-test-batch` (batch). Each scenario mirrors the PowerShell reference script: `nslookup ... 8.8.8.8` for DNS scenarios, `curl` for HTTP/HTTPS ones.
- **Verdict System** 🚦 Inverted verdict logic for C2 tests: `Enforced` (green) = threat was blocked/sinkholed, `Bypass` (red) = policy gap detected, `Inconclusive` = timeout/error.
- **Security Test Log** 📋 New `C2S` badge type in the log table, dedicated filter option "C2 Scenarios" in the dropdown, and correct "C2 Simulation" label in the Telemetry Diagnostic modal.
- **shared/security-categories.ts** 📦 New `C2_SCENARIOS` export with `C2Scenario` interface including CLI hint commands for each scenario.

## [v1.3.0-patch.1] - 2026-05-05
### Fixed
- **Web Dashboard**: 🐛 Fixed an issue where the `PORT` environment variable specified in `docker-compose.yml` was ignored. The dashboard port is no longer hardcoded to `8080` in `supervisord.conf`, allowing custom port bindings like `- PORT=8085` to work correctly.


## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-04
### Changed
- **Version Bump**: 🚀 Milestone release bumping the version to 1.3.0. This release consolidates all recent feature additions, VyOS orchestration integrations, and UI enhancements into a stable minor version.

## [v1.2.2-patch.172] - 2026-05-04
### Fixed
- **Web Dashboard**: 🐛 Fixed an issue in the Failover Monitoring (Convergence Lab) view where the stop button for an individual target in the "Stigix Targets" list remained greyed out and unclickable while a test was actively running.

## [v1.2.2-patch.171] - 2026-05-04
### Fixed
- **VyOS Engine**: 🐛 Fixed a bug where `allow-traffic` (simple-unblock) failed with "not blocked (tag 999 not found)" because the REST API parser was incorrectly looking for the `tag` attribute nested inside the `blackhole` presence node instead of as a sibling route attribute.
- **Web Dashboard**: 🧹 Fixed visual clutter in the Sequence Timeline where impairment parameters (latency, loss, rate) were incorrectly rendered for non-QoS actions like `deny-traffic`.
- **Web Dashboard**: 🧹 Fixed the Sequence Editor so that switching an action command (e.g. from `set-qos` to `deny-traffic`) automatically scrubs incompatible parameters from the configuration payload.

## [v1.2.2-patch.170] - 2026-04-30
### Changed
- **Web Dashboard**: 🔎 Enhanced history search. The sequence history search bar now comprehensively filters through human-readable router names, executed commands, target interfaces, parameters, and execution results (errors & status) simultaneously.

## [v1.2.2-patch.169] - 2026-04-30
### Added
- **Web Dashboard**: 🔍 Introduced a dynamic search bar in the VyOS sequence manager to instantly filter sequences by name, router focus, or underlying actions.
- **Web Dashboard**: 🔀 Added intelligent sorting to group sequences by target router, action command type, alphabetical name, or most recently executed.
- **Web Dashboard**: 🔄 Implemented "Clone to Reverse" functionality to automatically generate inverse automation sequences (e.g., swapping `interface-down` for `interface-up`, `set-qos` for `clear-qos`) with a single click.

## [v1.2.2-patch.168] - 2026-04-28
### Added
- **IoT DHCP**: In-kernel **BPF filter** (`udp src port 67 dst port 68`) replaces slow Python `lfilter` for DHCP packet capture — runs in the kernel before Python, no more missed ACKs under load. `stop_filter` terminates sniff immediately on XID match. ⚡
- **IoT DHCP**: **OFFER-without-ACK fallback** — 3-level hierarchy:
  1. ✅ Full ACK received → IP confirmed from DHCP server (best)
  2. 🟡 OFFER received but ACK timed out (unicast ACK dropped by kernel, DHCP snooping, etc.) → uses offered IP + detects host gateway from `ip route show default` → sends gratuitous ARP
  3. ❌ No OFFER at all → device stays silent until renewal loop retries
- **IoT DHCP**: `_get_host_gateway()` helper reads the host routing table as gateway fallback when no DHCP ACK is available. 🌐
- **IoT DHCP**: `_sniff_dhcp()` reusable helper shared by OFFER and ACK capture steps.
- **IoT DHCP**: `_dhcp_attempt()` now returns `'ack_ok' | 'offer_no_ack' | 'no_offer' | 'error'` instead of `bool` for full fallback context. 🔄

## [v1.2.2-patch.167] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT DHCP**: `self.ip` was assigned at REQUEST time (from the OFFER) before ACK confirmation. If ACK timed out, the stale offered IP leaked into `self.ip` — `_boot_sequence()` saw a non-null IP and started protocol threads with a ghost IP and no gateway (`HTTP SYN to None:80`). 🐛
  - Fix: removed premature `self.ip = dhcp_offered_ip` from REQUEST block.
  - `self.ip` is now exclusively set at line `msg_type == 5` (ACK confirmed).
  - `do_dhcp_sequence()` explicitly resets `self.ip = None` and `self.gateway = None` after all retries exhaust without success.

## [v1.2.2-patch.166] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT Daemon**: `SyntaxError: name 'ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR' is assigned to before global declaration` crashing the daemon on Python 3.12. 🔥
  - Root cause: two `global ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR` declarations in different `elif` branches of the same `daemon_loop()` function.
  - Fix: moved the single `global ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR` declaration to the very top of `daemon_loop()`, removing the per-branch declarations.

## [v1.2.2-patch.165] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT Bad Behavior**: Added early exit guard inside inner loops for all remaining behavior types — Clean Mode now stops ALL attack traffic within < 0.5s of clicking the button. 🛑
  - **C2 Beacon**: between DNS send and HTTP send (was waiting 1s)
  - **Data Exfil**: inside the 5-packet upload burst (was waiting 0.5s per packet)
  - **PAN Test DNS**: inside the 5-query burst (was waiting 1s per query)
  - **PAN Test URL**: inside the 3-URL burst (was waiting 2s per URL)

## [v1.2.2-patch.164] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT Bad Behavior**: `disable_bad_behavior` daemon command was missing `global ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR` declaration → Python created a local variable that disappeared immediately, leaving the global flag `True`. Clean Mode appeared to activate in the UI but had zero effect — devices stopped then restarted would still launch attacks. 🐛
- **IoT DNS Flood**: Added early exit inside the 10-query burst loop — thread stops within 0.5s of clean mode toggle instead of finishing the full burst. ⚡
- **IoT Port Scan**: Same early exit inside the 10-port scan loop — stops within 0.1s. ⚡

## [v1.2.2-patch.163] - 2026-04-28
### Performance
- **IoT Daemon**: Staggered device boot — each new device waits `(index × 2s + 0–1s jitter)` before calling `start()`. 30 devices spread over ~62 seconds instead of simultaneously → eliminates DHCP Discover storm on the router. ⏳
### Fixed
- **IoT Boot Sequence**: Refactored `start()` into a `_boot_sequence()` inner function:
  1. DHCP runs **blocking** (no more `time.sleep(2)` hack)
  2. If no IP after DHCP → abort silently, protocol threads and bad behavior **do NOT start**
  3. Protocol threads start only after IP is confirmed
  4. Bad behavior starts only after IP is confirmed — eliminates `💀 RANDOM MIX started` with no IP or gateway

## [v1.2.2-patch.162] - 2026-04-28
### Added
- **IoT**: Global **Bad Behavior toggle** button (`🗡️ Clean Mode` / `💀 Attack ON`) in the IoT filter bar — enables or disables attack mode across all configured devices in one click without restarting. 🔴
- **IoT Filter**: Search field now matches **MAC addresses** — type any OUI prefix or full MAC to filter devices. 🔍
### Fixed
- **DHCP**: Retry logic upgraded to **3 full attempts** with exponential backoff (2s, 4s between retries). Each attempt re-runs the full Discover→Offer→Request→ACK cycle. Timeout per phase raised to 4s. Eliminates fallback to hardcoded `192.168.207.x`. 🔄
- **DHCP**: Bad behavior threads now respect the global `ENABLE_BAD_BEHAVIOR` flag — toggling clean mode stops attack traffic on the next loop iteration without device restart. ✅

## [v1.2.2-patch.161] - 2026-04-28
### Performance
- **IoT Architecture**: Migrated from **N processes (1 per device)** to a single persistent Python daemon managing all devices as internal threads. 🚀
  - RAM: ~600MB (30 devices) → ~50MB. CPU overhead dramatically reduced.
  - Practical device limit: ~15–20 → **100+ devices** on the same container.
  - Single process reads JSON commands from stdin: `start`, `stop`, `stop_all`, `status`, `enable_bad_behavior`, `disable_bad_behavior`.
  - All UI events (`device:log`, `device:stats`, `device:started`, `device:stopped`) unchanged — fully transparent to the frontend.
- **IoT Daemon**: Exponential backoff restart strategy in `iot-manager.ts` — 5 max retries (2s→4s→8s→16s→30s), re-sends start commands for all tracked devices on recovery. 🔁
- **IoT UI**: Persistent red banner displayed when daemon gives up after 5 crash-restart cycles. 🔴

## [v1.2.2-patch.160] - 2026-04-28
### Added
- **IoT DHCP**: `BOOTP` broadcast flag (`0x8000`), explicit `htype=1` / `hlen=6`, DHCP Option 57 (`max_dhcp_size=1500`) for realistic network stack fingerprinting. 📡
- **IoT ARP**: Gratuitous ARP (`is-at`) sent immediately after DHCP ACK — critical MAC↔IP binding signal for Prisma IoT Security classification. 📣
- **IoT DHCP**: ARP thread now waits for valid IP+gateway from DHCP before initiating requests. ⏳
### Fixed
- **IoT Bad Behavior**: Bad behavior threads skip gateway-targeted actions when gateway has not been learned yet (no more spurious traffic to unrelated IPs). 🛡️

## [v1.2.2-patch.159] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **IoT UI**: Replaced vendor `<select>` dropdown with a free-text `<input>` field — vendor names from imported JSON (e.g., "Apple Inc.", "VMware, Inc.") are now preserved instead of defaulting to "Generic". ✅
- **IoT Emulator**: Default gateway changed from hardcoded `192.168.207.1` to `None` — emulator now waits for the gateway address from the DHCP ACK dynamically. 🌐

## [v1.2.2-patch.158] - 2026-04-28
### Changed
- **IoT Import**: Removed `ip_start` field from `import_prisma_devices.py` JSON export — devices now use the site DHCP server exclusively, no subnet assignment. 🔄

## [v1.2.2-patch.157] - 2026-04-28
### Added
- **IoT Import**: `--max-devices N` option on `import_prisma_devices.py` — limits generated output to the top N highest-risk devices (default 30, sorted by risk score descending). 📋
### Documentation
- Updated `generate_iot_devices.md` with `--max-devices` option reference. 📚

## [v1.2.2-patch.156] - 2026-04-28

## [v1.2.2-patch.154] - 2026-04-27
### Added
- **Voice/RTP**: Full legacy behavior emulation in RTP debug mode — `tos=0`, randomized source port for DPI bypass during media classification testing. 🎙️

## [v1.2.2-patch.153] - 2026-04-27
### Fixed
- **Voice/RTP**: Debug logs from `rtp.py` forwarded to `stderr` to prevent orchestrator `stdout` capture from mixing log and data streams. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.152] - 2026-04-27
### Added
- **Voice/RTP**: DEBUG mode in `rtp.py` — strips CID prefix from RTP payload to support DPI media classification by Prisma Access. 🔬

## [v1.2.2-patch.151] - 2026-04-27
### Fixed
- **VyOS Control**: Improved unblock error handling when IP is part of a larger subnet — displays actionable error message instead of silent failure. 🛡️

## [v1.2.2-patch.100] - 2026-04-22
### Refactored
- **Target Worker Auth**: Removed `SHARED_KEY` / `STIGIX_TARGET_SHARED_KEY` — `MASTER_SIGNATURE_KEY` is now the only supported authentication method. Derived key per request: `SHA256(TSGID:MASTER_KEY)`. Worker falls through to open-access if no master key is configured. 🔐
- **target-manager.ts**: Removed `STIGIX_TARGET_SHARED_KEY` env fallback and the PoC derived key (`SHA256(tsg:clientId:stigix-v1)`). Clear warnings logged when key is missing. 🧹
### Changed
- **docker-compose.yml**: Removed `STIGIX_TARGET_SHARED_KEY` env variable. 🐳
- **install.sh**: Removed `STIGIX_TARGET_SHARED_KEY` from generated `.env` template.
- **docs**: Updated `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` and `.env.example` to reflect single-key auth model. 📚

## [v1.2.2-patch.99] - 2026-04-22
### Performance
- **Traffic Generator**: Added `--ipv4` flag to all `curl` calls. Host has no IPv6 route — without this, curl tried all AAAA addresses first (each failing with "Network is unreachable") before falling back to A records, wasting 1–2s per request on dual-stack destinations. ⚡

## [v1.2.2-patch.98] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Rate Card**: `currentRpm` was never persisted — Traffic Rate always showed `0` on browser refresh. Now seeded from the last history entry on init and written to `localStorage` as `stigix_rpm_cache` on every update. 📊
- **History Writer**: The 60s snapshot collector (`traffic-history.jsonl`) was reading `stats.json` directly (the old single-client file) instead of calling `aggregateStats()`. With multi-client traffic, this recorded ~1/N of actual traffic, causing chart totals to diverge from stat cards and seeding wrong RPM on refresh. Fixed to use `aggregateStats()` consistently. 🛠️
- **Rotation**: Replaced `exec(wc -l / tail)` in history rotation with pure `fs` to avoid exec buffer limit issues.

## [v1.2.2-patch.97] - 2026-04-22
### Added
- **Dashboard Persistence**: Stats and chart history now survive browser refresh via `localStorage` caching. 💾
  - `stats` initialized from `stigix_stats_cache` on load — no flash to zero on refresh.
  - History cached per time-range key (`stigix_history_1h/6h/24h`, last 300 points).
  - `fetchHistory()` and live `processStats()` both write to localStorage on every update.
  - Switching time ranges immediately shows the cached history while the API loads.

## [v1.2.2-patch.96] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Control Dashboard**: Switching to another tab caused the entire Traffic Control view (including `LineChart`) to unmount. On return, recharts re-animated the line from zero. Fixed by keeping the dashboard always mounted in the DOM with CSS `hidden` class — component never unmounts. 🔒
- **Chart**: Added `isAnimationActive={false}` on the `Line` component as a safety net against edge-case remounts.

## [v1.2.2-patch.95] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Polling Intervals**: Tab switching triggered a full teardown and restart of all polling intervals because `view` was in the main `useEffect` dependency array. Split into two separate effects — initialization (runs once on login) and view-specific polling — preventing interval churn on navigation. ⏱️

## [v1.2.2-patch.94] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Chart Axes**: Y/X axis labels were invisible in light mode. SVG elements inside recharts cannot inherit CSS custom properties. Replaced dynamic `var(--color-text-muted)` with concrete `#64748b` (neutral slate). 🎨
- **Stats Aggregation**: Implemented 3-minute recency filter in `aggregateStats()` — only stats files modified within the last 3 minutes are included, preventing stale files from previous container runs or crashed workers from polluting totals. 🧹
- **Density Default**: Stop API endpoint now explicitly resets `client_count` to `1` on disk, ensuring the UI slider correctly reflects the state on fresh startups. 🎛️

## [v1.2.2-patch.93] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Dashboard API**: `/api/admin/system/dashboard-data` was reading `stats.json` (legacy single-client file) directly instead of calling `aggregateStats()`. Multi-client stats were never reflected in the stat cards. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.92] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Generator**: `STATS_FILE` variable was assigned before `CLIENTID` was set — all workers wrote to `stats-.json` (empty suffix) instead of their own `stats-client-XX-YYY.json` file. Fixed initialization order. 🐛

## [v1.2.2-patch.91] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Generator**: `getWeightedApp()` was called inside a `$(...)` subshell for process detection — the app cache array built inside never persisted to the parent shell, so `jq` ran on every single request. Refactored to use an internal PID registry and moved cache initialization to the parent scope. ⚡
- **Backend**: Fixed `maxBuffer` crash in `exec()` calls when log output exceeded the Node.js default buffer limit. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.90] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Generator**: Replaced `pgrep` (unreliable for detecting worker processes by name) with an internal PID registry array in the master loop, ensuring accurate worker count tracking and scale-up/scale-down decisions. 🔄

## [v1.2.2-patch.89] - 2026-04-22
### Performance
- **Traffic Generator**: Three targeted optimizations for density scaling: pre-cached application list, reduced sleep granularity for faster ramp-up, and improved worker lifecycle management. ⚡

## [v1.2.2-patch.88] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- **Traffic Generator**: Stabilized multi-client scaling logic and fixed stats aggregation across parallel worker processes. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.87] - 2026-04-22
### Added
- **Traffic Generator**: Multi-client scaling — the master process dynamically spawns/terminates worker instances based on the configured `client_count` density slider. Each worker writes its own `stats-client-XX-YYY.json` file. Workers are identified by a shared session suffix. 📈
- **Dashboard**: Traffic Density slider (1–10 parallel clients) and Traffic Speed slider exposed in the Traffic Control panel. 🎛️

## [v1.2.2-patch.82] - 2026-04-22
### Added
- **Security Score**: Min/max score display on gauge cards. 📊
- **Security Score**: "Change" column in test result tables showing delta vs. previous run.
- **Security Score**: "Changes Only" filter to focus the result list on categories that shifted status.
- **Security Score**: 24h score trend visualization. 📈

## [v1.2.2-patch.75] - 2026-04-21
### Changed
- **Security Score**: Added score description subtitles on each gauge card — URL Score explains "Weighted % of malicious URL categories correctly blocked by firewall", DNS Score explains "Weighted % of malicious DNS domains correctly blocked or sinkholed". 📝
- **Security Score**: Added `ⓘ` tooltip on the BASELINE label explaining the purpose of pinning a reference run and how gap alerting works. 💡

## [v1.2.2-patch.74] - 2026-04-21
### Added
- **Security Score**: Added **Latest Changes** panel — client-side diff between the two most recent consecutive runs per type (URL/DNS). Shows exactly which categories changed status with `↓ GAP` / `↑ FIXED` / `CHG` badges and a time range. No baseline required. 🔍
- **Security Score**: Chart dot decimation — dots now only appear every 5-minute window to prevent clutter when tests run every minute. The score line itself still renders all data points. ⚡

## [v1.2.2-patch.73] - 2026-04-21
### Added
- **Security Score**: Run markers on the Score Trend chart — colored dots (🟣 URL, 🔵 DNS) appear at each actual test execution. Scheduled runs display an additional outer ring to distinguish them from manual runs. 📍
- **Security Score**: Rich custom chart tooltip showing exact date/time, trigger type (▶ Manual / 🕐 Scheduled), and both URL+DNS scores on hover. 🎯
- **Security Score**: Legend in chart header: `● URL  ● DNS  ○ Scheduled`. 📊

## [v1.2.2-patch.72] - 2026-04-21
### Fixed
- **Security Score**: Fixed `ScoreDashboard` not showing any data — all 5 `fetch()` calls were missing `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers, causing silent 401 responses. Added `token` prop to `ScoreDashboard`, passed from `Security.tsx` parent. 🔐

## [v1.2.2-patch.71] - 2026-04-21
### Fixed
- **Security Score**: Fixed `runId` missing from `TestResult` interface in `test-logger.ts`. TypeScript was silently dropping the `runId` field on every logged entry, making score grouping impossible — `generateRunScore()` always found 0 results and returned early. 🛠️

## [v1.2.2-patch.42] - 2026-04-17
### Changed
- **Settings UI**: Restructured the Custom Probe Configuration form layout. Upgraded from a cramped 4-column layout into a spacious 2-column grid layout spanning two rows to completely eliminate tight text wrapping. 📐

## [v1.2.2-patch.39] - 2026-04-17
### Added
- **Settings UI**: Re-styled the Probe form, injecting an explicit `MIN 1000 — MAX 60000` helper text directly opposite the Timeout label for superior transparency. ✨

## [v1.2.2-patch.38] - 2026-04-17
### Added
- **Probes**: Introduced an editable `Timeout (ms)` property natively into the Synthetic Probes UI builder, giving users maximum tuning control over execution limits. ⚙️
- **Probes**: Injected a bulletproof `1000ms` safe-minimum limit to protect the backend bash-level tools from zero-timeout infinite execution traps. 🛡️

## [v1.2.2-patch.37] - 2026-04-17
### Added
- **Convergence Dashboard**: Added Live Packet Loss tracking chart to the convergence timeline display. 📉
